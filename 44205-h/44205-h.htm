<p>Prior to the adoption of the <i>Sistema Central</i> in the Mexican
republic, the province of New Mexico was under a territorial
government. The executive was called <dfn>Gefe Político</dfn>
(political chief), and the <dfn>Diputacion Provincial</dfn> very inefficiently
supplied the place of a legislature. Under the
present system, however, New Mexico being a <dfn>department</dfn>,
the names of these powers have been changed, but their
functions remain very nearly the same. The <dfn>Gobernador</dfn>
(governor) is appointed by the President for eight years.
The legislative power is nominally vested in a <dfn>Junta Departamental</dfn>,
a kind of state council, with very circumscribed
{226} powers, somewhat analogous to, and certainly not more
extensive than, those of a board of aldermen with us. But
even this shadow of popular representation was 'prorogued'
by Gov. Armijo soon after his accession to power (five or
six years ago), and has never since been convened; so that
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg022"></a>[p022]</span>
its functions have been arbitrarily exercised by the governor
ever since.</p>

<p>The administration of the laws in Northern Mexico
constitutes one of the most painful features of her institutions.
Justice, or rather judgments, are a common article
of traffic; and the hapless litigant who has not the means
to soften the claws of the alcalde with a 'silver unction,'
is almost sure to get severely scratched in the contest, no
matter what may be the justice of his cause, or the uprightness
of his character. It is easy to perceive, then, that the
poor and the humble stand no chance in a judicial contest
with the wealthy and consequential, whose influence, even
apart from their facilities for corrupting the court and
suborning witnesses, is sufficient to neutralize any amount
of plebeian testimony that might be brought against them.</p>

<p>The evil consequences arising from maladministration
of justice in New Mexico are most severely felt by foreigners,
against whom a strong prejudice prevails throughout the
South. Of these, the citizens of the United States are by
far the most constant sufferers; an inevitable result of that
sinister feeling with which the 'rival republic' views the
advancement {227} and superiority of her more industrious
neighbors. It is a notorious fact, that while the English are
universally treated with comparative consideration and
respect, the Americans residing in the southern parts of
the republic are frequently taunted with the effeminacy of
their government and its want of decision. So openly has
this preference for British subjects been manifested, and
so thoroughly conscious have the Americans become of
the humiliating fact, that when a mercantile firm, consisting
of an American and an Englishman, has occasion to present
a memorial of any description, or to sue either for an act of
favor or of justice from the nation, the application is sure
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg023"></a>[p023]</span>
to be made in the name of the latter, knowing it will thus be
more likely to command proper attention.</p>

<p>Few men, perhaps, have done more to jeopard the interests
of American traders, or to bring the American character
itself into contempt, than Armijo, the present arbitrary
governor of New Mexico. I am happy to say, however, that
in the midst of his many oppressions, he was once at least
obliged to 'knock under' to one of those bold and daring
spirits of the Rocky Mountains whom obstacles rather
energize than subdue. This was about the year 1828, during
Armijo's previous governorship. A law was then in existence
which had been enacted by the general Congress prohibiting
foreigners from trapping beaver in the Mexican territory,
under penalty of confiscation, etc.; but as there were
no native {228} trappers in New Mexico, Gov. Baca and his
successor (Narbona) thought it expedient to extend licenses
to foreigners, in the name of citizens, upon condition of their
taking a certain proportion of Mexicans to learn the art of
trapping. In pursuance of this disposition, Gov. Narbona
extended a license to one Ewing Young, who was accompanied
by a Mr. Sublette, brother of Capt. Wm. Sublette,
and almost equally celebrated for his mountain adventures.<a
name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg024"></a>[p024]</span>
Previous to the return of this party from their trapping
expedition, Armijo had succeeded Narbona in office, and
they were informed that it was his intention to seize their
furs. To prevent this, they deposited them at a neighboring
village, where they were afterwards discovered, seized, and
confiscated. The furs being damp, they were spread out in
the sun before the <i>Guardia</i>, in Santa Fé, when Sublette, perceiving
two packs of beaver which had been his own property,
got by honest labor, instantly seized them and carried them
away before the eyes of the whole garrison, and concealed
both them and his own person in a house opposite. The
entire military force was immediately put in requisition, and
a general search made for the offender and his prize; but
in vain: indeed, if the truth must be spoken, the troops
seemed to have as little desire to find Sublette as the latter
had of being found; for his character was too well known to
leave any room for hope that his capture could be effected
without a great deal {229} of trouble. In the meanwhile,
Armijo raved, and threatened the Americans for not ferreting
out their countryman and delivering him over to justice.
Failing to produce any impression by blustering, however,
he caused a couple of cannons to be pointed at the house
where the offender was supposed to be concealed, declaring
at the same time that he would batter it down; but all to no
purpose. Mr. Sublette finally conveyed his furs in safety
to the frontier, and thence to the United States.
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg025"></a>[p025]</span></p>

<p>
The following anecdote affords another illustration of
Armijo's summary mode of dealing with Americans. In
the fall of 1840, a gross outrage was committed upon a
physician from Massachusetts (said to be a gentleman of
unexceptionable deportment), who was travelling through
the country for his health. He had loaned nine hundred
dollars to a person of the name of Tayon, who afterwards
borrowed the same amount of another foreigner and repaid
this debt. The doctor then left for the South, where he
intended to pass the winter, being afflicted with a pulmonary
disease. But the individual who had lent Tayon the money,
being informed that he was insolvent, applied to Gov. Armijo
for an order to compel the doctor to return, expecting thereby
to make him reimburse the money. The order overtook
him at the village of Algodones,<a name="FNanchor_3_3"
id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
near forty miles from Santa
Fé, where he was at once arrested by the alcalde, and detained
some time, ignorant even of the offence for which he was doing
penance. {230} In the meantime, the American Consul at
Santa Fé, having been informed of what had taken place,
procured a counter-order from the governor for the release
of the prisoner. When the alcalde of Algodones received this
document, he determined at once that so extraordinary an
act of justice should cost the foreigner some trifle. Accordingly,
another order was forged on the spot, commanding
that he should be taken to the capital—yet a 'gentle hint'
was given, that his liberty might be purchased by the payment
of two hundred dollars. Being in a land of strangers,
among whom he had but little hope of receiving fair play,
the doctor resolved to pay the amount demanded, and fly
to Chihuahua, where he would at least be safe from Armijo's
clutches. Having been informed, however, of the fraud
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg026"></a>[p026]</span>
practised by the alcalde, before he had proceeded far on his
journey, he returned and made an attempt to bring the
delinquent officer to justice, but altogether without success.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most glaring outrages upon American
citizens were committed in 1841, upon the occasion of the
capture of the Texan Santa Fé Expedition. In Taos, a
poor deaf and dumb U. S. creole Frenchman was beaten to
death in open day. In San Miguel, the alcalde, at the head
of a mob, entered the store of a Mr. Rowland, whom he
robbed of a considerable amount of merchandise.<a
name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> At the
same time, the greatest excitement raged in Santa Fé against
Americans, whose lives appeared in imminent danger; and
a most {231} savage attack was made upon our excellent
Consul, Manuel Alvarez, Esq., who had always taken an
active interest in the welfare of American citizens.<a
name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>A few minutes after the governor had departed for San
Miguel, to encounter the Texans, a fellow named Martin, his
nephew and confidential agent, aided by a band of ferocious
<i>sans culottes</i>, and armed with a large knife, secretly entered
the house of the Consul, who perceived him in time, however,
to avert the blow; yet he received a severe wound in the
face during the scuffle that ensued: the rabble running in
at the same time, and vociferating, "<dfn>Sáquenlo ajuera! mátenlo!</dfn>"—Drag
him out! kill him! Mr. Alvarez doubtless
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg027"></a>[p027]</span> owed his
preservation partially to the consternation with
which the failure of their clandestine attempt at his life
inspired the cowardly ruffians. Instead of being punished
for this diabolical act, the principal assassin, on the contrary,
was soon after promoted in the army.</p>

<p>The outrage did not end here, however; for on the Consul's
demanding his passport for the United States, it was
refused for nearly a month; thus detaining him until the cold
season had so far advanced, that, of his party (about fifteen
in number), two perished from the cold; and not one arrived
without being more or less frost-bitten—some very severely—besides
suffering a loss of about fifty animals from the
same cause.</p>

<p>Although these and other daring outrages have been duly
represented to our Government, {232} it does not appear
that any measures of redress have yet been taken.</p>

<p>With a view of oppressing our merchants, Gov. Armijo
had, as early as 1839, issued a decree exempting all the
natives from the tax imposed on store-houses, shops, etc.,
throwing the whole burden of impost upon foreigners and
naturalized citizens; a measure clearly and unequivocally
at variance with the treaties and stipulations entered into
between the United States and Mexico. A protest was presented
without effect; when our Consul, finding all remonstrances
useless, forwarded a memorial to the American
Minister at Mexico,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a
href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who, although the vital interests of
American citizens were at stake, deemed the affair of too
little importance, perhaps, and therefore appears to have
paid no attention to it. But this system of levying excessive
taxes upon foreigners, is by no means an original invention of
Gov. Armijo. In 1835, the government of Chihuahua having
levied a <dfn>contribucion de guerra</dfn> for raising means to make
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg028"></a>[p028]</span> war upon the
savages, who were laying waste the surrounding
country, foreign merchants, with an equal disregard for their
rights and the obligations of treaties, were taxed twenty-five
dollars each per month; while the native merchants, many
of whom possessed large haciendas, with thousands of stock,
for the especial protection of which these taxes were chiefly
imposed, paid only from five to ten dollars each. Remonstrances
were presented to the governor, but in vain. In his
official {233} reply, that functionary declared, "<dfn>que el gobierno
cree arreglado el reparto de sus respectivas contribuciones</dfn>,"—the
government believes your respective contributions in
accordance with justice—which concluded the correspondence,
and the Americans paid their twenty-five dollars per
month.</p>

<p>The only tribunals of 'justice' in New Mexico are those
of the ordinary <dfn>alcaldes</dfn> or justices of the peace; and an appeal
from them is carried to the Supreme Court in the department
of Chihuahua. The course of litigation is exceedingly
simple and summary. The plaintiff makes his verbal complaint
or demand before the alcalde, who orders him to
summon the defendant, which is done by simply saying,
"<dfn>Le llama el alcalde</dfn>" (the alcalde calls you) into his presence,
the applicant acting thus in the double capacity of constable
and complainant. The summons is always verbal,
and rarely for a future time—instant attendance being
expected. Should the defendant refuse to obey this simple
mandate (which, by the bye, is a very rare occurrence), the
alcalde sends his <dfn>baston de justicia</dfn>, his staff of justice, an
ordinary walking-cane, distinguished only by a peculiar
black silk tassel. This never fails to enforce compliance,
for a refusal to attend after being shown the staff, would be
construed into a contempt of court, and punished accordingly.
The witnesses are sometimes sworn upon a cross cut on the
<i>baston de justicia</i>, or more frequently, perhaps, upon a cross
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg029"></a>[p029]</span> formed with {234}
the finger and thumb. Generally speaking,
however, the process of examination is gone through
without a single oath being administered; and in the absence
of witnesses, the alcalde often proceeds to sentence upon the
simple statements of the contending parties. By a species
of mutual agreement, the issue of a suit is sometimes referred
to <dfn>hombres buenos</dfn> (arbitrators), which is the nearest approximation
that is made to trial by jury. In judicial proceedings,
however, but little, or rather no attention is paid to any code
of laws; in fact, there is scarcely one alcalde in a dozen who
knows what a law is, or who ever saw a law-book. Their
decisions, when not influenced by corrupt agencies, are controlled
by the prevailing customs of the country.</p>

<p>In the administration of justice, there are three distinct
and privileged jurisdictions, known as <dfn>fueros</dfn>:<a
name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the <dfn>eclesiástico</dfn>,
which provides that no member of the clergy, at least of the
rank of curate and upwards, shall ever be arraigned before a
civil tribunal, but shall be tried by their superiors in the order;
the <dfn>militar</dfn>, which makes a similar provision in favor not
only of commissioned officers, but of every common soldier
from the ranks; and the <dfn>civil</dfn> or ordinary courts, for all cases
in which the defendants are laymen. These <dfn>fueros</dfn> have
hitherto maintained the ecclesiastical and military classes
in perfect independence of the civil authorities. The <i>civil</i>, in
fact, remains in some degree subordinate to the other two
<i>fueros</i>; for it can, under no circumstances, {235} have any
jurisdiction whatever over them; while the lay plaintiff, in
the privileged tribunals of these, may, if unsuccessful, have
judgment entered up against him: a consequence that can
never follow the suits of the ecclesiastical or military orders
before the civil tribunals. The judgments of the latter, in <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg030"></a>[p030]</span>
such cases, would be void. It is no wonder, then, that the
cause of freedom in Mexico has made so little progress.</p>

<p>Imprisonment is almost the only sort of punishment resorted
to in the North. For debt, petit larceny, highway
robbery, and murder, the usual sentence is "<dfn>A la cárcel</dfn>"
(to jail), where a person is likely to remain about as long for
inability to pay <i>dos reales</i>, as for the worst of crimes: always
provided he has not the means to pacify the offended majesty
of the law. I never heard of but one execution for murder
in New Mexico, since the declaration of independence. The
most desperate and blood-stained criminals escape with
impunity, after a few weeks of incarceration, unless the
prosecutor happens to be a person of great influence; in
which case, the prisoner is detained in the <i>calabozo</i> at will,
even when the offence committed has been of a trivial character.
Notwithstanding this laxity in the execution of the
laws, there are few murders of any kind committed.</p>

<p>In case of debt, as before remarked, the delinquent is sent
to jail—provided the creditor will not accept his services.
If he will, however, the debtor becomes <dfn>nolens volens</dfn> the {236}
servant of the creditor till the debt is satisfied; and, serving,
as he does, at very reduced wages, his expenses for clothing,
and other necessaries, but too often retain him in perpetual
servitude. This system does not operate, however, upon
the higher classes, yet it acts with terrible severity upon the
unfortunate poor, whose condition is but little better, if not
worse indeed than that of the slaves of the South. They
labor for fixed wages, it is true; but all they can earn is hardly
sufficient to keep them in the coarsest clothing and pay their
contingent expenses. Men's wages range from two to five
dollars a month, and those of women from fifty cents to two
dollars; in payment of which, they rarely receive any money;
but instead thereof, articles of apparel and other necessaries
at the most exorbitant prices. The consequence is that the <span class="xxpgno">
<a id="Pg031"></a>[p031]</span>
servant soon accumulates a debt which he is unable to pay—his
wages being often engaged for a year or two in advance.
Now, according to the usages, if not the laws of the country,
he is bound to serve his master until all arrearages are
liquidated; and is only enabled to effect an exchange of
masters, by engaging another to pay his debt, to whom he
becomes in like manner bound.</p>

<p>As I have already remarked, capital crimes and highway
robberies are of comparatively rare occurrence in the North,
but in smaller delinquencies, such as pilfering and petty
rogueries of every shade and description, the common classes
can very successfully compete {237} with any other people.
Nothing indeed can be left exposed or unguarded without
great danger of its being immediately stolen. No husbandman
would think of leaving his axe or his hoe, or anything
else of the slightest value, lying out over night. Empty
wagons are often pillaged of every movable piece of iron,
and even the wheels have been carried away. Pieces of
merchandise are frequently purloined from the shelves, when
they happen to be in reach. In Chihuahua, goods have
actually been snatched from the counter while being exposed
to the inspection of a pretended purchaser. I once had a
trick of this kind played upon me by a couple of boys, who
made their escape through a crowd of spectators with their
booty exposed. In vain I cried "<dfn>Agarren á los ladrones!</dfn>"
(catch the thieves!) not a single individual moved to apprehend
them. I then proffered the goods stolen, to any person
who might succeed in bringing the rogues to me, but
to no purpose. In fact there seems to exist a great deal of
repugnance, even among the better classes, to apprehending
thieves; as if the mere act of informing against them was
considered dishonorable. I heard a very respectable caballero
once remark that he had seen a man purloin certain
articles of merchandise, but he could not be induced to give
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg032"></a>[p032]</span>
up his name; observing, "O, I can't think of exposing the
poor fellow!"</p>

<p>The impunity with which delinquencies of this description
are every day committed is {238} perhaps in some degree,
the consequence of those severe enactments, such as the
<dfn>Leyes de las Indias</dfn> (the laws of the Indies), which rendered
many thefts and robberies punishable with death.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The
magistracy contracted the habit of frequently winking at
crime, rather than resort to the barbarous expedients prescribed
by the letter of the law. The utmost that can be
gained now by public prosecution, is the recovery of the
stolen property, if that be anywhere to be found, and occasionally
a short period of imprisonment for the culprit. This
is more particularly the case when the prosecutor happens
to be a foreigner; while on the other hand, if he be the party
accused, he is likely to be subjected to very severe treatment.
A remarkable circumstance of this kind occurred in Chihuahua
in the year 1835. One of our most respectable
Missouri merchants had bought a mule of a stranger, but
the animal was soon after claimed by a third person, who
proved that it had been stolen from him. The Missourian
would have been perfectly satisfied to lose the mule, and end
the matter there; but to the surprise of all, he was directly
summoned before an alcalde, and forthwith sentenced to
jail: the partial judge having labored to fix the theft upon
the innocent purchaser, while the real culprit, who was a
native, was permitted to go at large.</p>

<p>The love of gambling also deserves to be noticed as a
distinguishing propensity of these people. Indeed it may
well be said, without any undue stretch of imagination, that
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg033"></a>[p033]</span>
shop-lifting, {239} pocket-picking, and other elegant pastimes
of the same kindred, are the legitimate offspring, especially
among the lower classes, of that passion for gaming, which
in Mexico more than anywhere else—to use Madame
Calderon's language<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
—"is impregnated with the constitution—in
man, woman, and child." It prevails in the
lowly hut, as well as in the glittering saloon; nor is the
sanctity of the gown nor the dignity of station sufficient
proof against the fascinations of this exciting vice. No one
considers it a degradation to be seen frequenting a <i>monte
bank</i>: the governor himself and his lady, the grave magistrate
and the priestly dignity, the gay caballero and the titled
señora may all be seen staking their doubloons upon the
turn of a card; while the humbler ranchero, the hired
domestic and the ragged pauper, all press with equal avidity
to test their fortune at the same shrine. There are other
games at cards practised among these people, depending
more upon skill; but that of <i>el monte</i>, being one exclusively
of chance, seems to possess an all-absorbing attraction,
difficult to be conceived by the uninitiated spectator.</p>

<p>The following will not only serve to show the light in which
gambling is held by all classes of society, but to illustrate the
purifying effects of wealth upon character. Some twelve
or fifteen years ago there lived (or rather roamed) in Taos
a certain female of very loose habits, known as <dfn>La Tules</dfn>.
Finding it difficult to obtain the means of living in that {240}
district, she finally extended her wanderings to the capital.
She there became a constant attendant on one of those
pandemoniums where the favorite game of <i>monte</i> was dealt
<i>pro bono publico</i>. Fortune, at first, did not seem inclined
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg034"></a>[p034]</span>
to smile upon her efforts, and for some years she spent her
days in lowliness and misery. At last her luck turned, as
gamblers would say, and on one occasion she left the bank
with a spoil of several hundred dollars! This enabled her
to open a bank of her own, and being favored by a continuous
run of good fortune, she gradually rose higher and higher in
the scale of affluence, until she found herself in possession
of a very handsome fortune. In 1843, she sent to the
United States some ten thousand dollars to be invested in
goods. She still continues her favorite 'amusement,' being
now considered the most expert 'monte dealer' in all Santa
Fé. She is openly received in the first circles of society:
I doubt, in truth, whether there is to be found in the city a
lady of more fashionable reputation than this same Tules,
now known as Señora Doña Gertrudes Barceló.</p>

<p>Among the multitude of games which seem to constitute
the real business of life in New Mexico, that of <dfn>chuza</dfn> evidently
presents the most attractions to ladies; and they
generally lay very heavy wagers upon the result. It is
played with little balls, and bears some faint resemblance
to what is called <i>roulette</i>. Bull-baiting and cock-fighting,
about which so much has been said by every traveller in
Mexico, {241} are also very popular 'amusements' in the
North, and generally lead to the same excesses and the same
results as gaming. The cock-pit rarely fails to be crowded
on Sundays and other feast days; on which occasions the
church, the ball-room, the gambling-house, and the cock-pit
look like so many opposition establishments; for nothing
is more common than to see people going from one place to
another by alternate fits, just as devotional feeling or love of
pleasure happens to prompt them.</p>

<p>One of the most attractive sports of the rancheros and the
peasantry, and that which, more than any other, calls for
the exercise of skill and dexterity, is that called <dfn>correr el gallo</dfn>, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg035"></a>[p035]</span>
practised generally on St. John's day. A common cock or
hen is tied by the feet to some swinging limb of a tree, so as
to be barely within the reach of a man on horseback: or the
fowl is buried alive in a small pit in the ground leaving only
the head above the surface. In either case, the racers,
passing at full speed, grapple the head of the fowl, which
being well greased, generally slips out of their fingers. As
soon as some one, more dextrous than the rest, has succeeded
in tearing it loose, he claps spurs to his steed, and endeavors
to escape with the prize. He is hotly pursued, however,
by the whole sporting crew, and the first who overtakes him
tries to get possession of the fowl, when a strife ensues, during
which the poor chicken is torn into atoms. Should the
holder of the trophy be able to outstrip his pursuers, he
carries {242} it to a crowd of fair spectators and presents it
to his mistress, who takes it to the fandango which usually
follows, as a testimony of the prowess of her lover.</p>

<p>Among the vaqueros, and even among persons of distinction,
<dfn>el coleo</dfn> (tailing) is a much nobler exercise than the
preceding, and is also generally reserved for days of festivity.
For this sport the most untractable ox or bull is turned
loose upon a level common, when all the parties who propose
to join in the amusement, being already mounted, start off
in pursuit of him. The most successful rider, as soon as he
gets near enough to the bull, seizes him by the tail, and with
a sudden manœuvre, whirls him topsy-turvy upon the plain—to
the no little risk of breaking his own neck, should his
horse stumble or be tripped by the legs of the falling bull.</p>

<p>Respecting <dfn>fandangos</dfn>, I will observe that this term, as it
is used in New Mexico, is never applied to any particular
dance, but is the usual designation for those ordinary assemblies
where dancing and frolicking are carried on; <dfn>baile</dfn>
(or ball) being generally applied to those of a higher grade.
The former especially are very frequent; for nothing is more <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg036"></a>[p036]</span>
general, throughout the country, and with all classes than
dancing. From the gravest priest to the buffoon—from
the richest nabob to the beggar—from the governor to the
ranchero—from the soberest matron to the flippant belle—from
the grandest <i>señora</i> to the <i>cocinera</i>—all partake of this
exhilarating {243} amusement. To judge from the quantity
of tuned instruments which salute the ear almost every night
in the week, one would suppose that a perpetual carnival
prevailed everywhere. The musical instruments used at
the <dfn>bailes</dfn> and <dfn>fandangos</dfn> are usually the fiddle and <dfn>bandolin</dfn>,
or <dfn>guitarra</dfn>, accompanied in some villages by the <dfn>tombé</dfn> or
little Indian drum. The musicians occasionally acquire
considerable proficiency in the use of these instruments.
But what most oddly greets, and really outrages most Protestant
ears, is the accompaniment of divine service with
the very same instruments, and often with the same tunes.</p>

<p>Of all the petty vices practised by the New Mexicans, the
<dfn>vicio inocente</dfn> of smoking among ladies, is the most intolerable;
and yet it is a habit of which the loveliest and the most
refined equally partake. The <dfn>puro</dfn> or <dfn>cigarro</dfn><a
name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
is seen in
the mouths of all: it is handed round in the parlor, and
introduced at the dinner table—even in the ball-room it is
presented to ladies as regularly as any {244} other species of
'refreshment;' and in the dance the señorita may often be
seen whirling round with a lighted <dfn>cigarrito</dfn> in her mouth.
The belles of the Southern cities are very frequently furnished <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg037"></a>[p037]</span>
with <dfn>tenazitas de oro</dfn> (little golden tongs), to hold
the cigar with, so as to prevent their delicate fingers from
being polluted either with the stain or scent of tobacco;
forgetting at the same time its disagreeable effects upon
the lips and breath.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their numerous vices, however, I should
do the New Mexicans the justice to say that they are but
little addicted to inebriety and its attendant dissipations.
Yet this doubtlessly results to a considerable degree from
the dearness of spirituous liquors, which virtually places them
beyond the reach of the lower classes.</p>

Ewing Young was a native of Knox County, Tennessee. He early went west
for hunting and trapping, having passports for Mexican territory signed at Washington
in 1828-29. In these years he made his first overland trip from New Mexico
to California, where he aided the padres of San José in an expedition against revolted
neophytes. In 1829 he returned to New Mexico, married a Taos woman,
and again (1831) set out for California. There in 1834 he met Hall Kelley, and
was persuaded to accompany him to Oregon, where he formed one of the first
American settlements in the Chehalem Valley, tributary to the Willamette. A
journey to California in 1836, to purchase cattle, resulted in stocking the Oregon
pioneers. Young's Oregon settlement prospered; he erected saw and grist mills,
and upon his death (1841) the administration of his estate was the occasion of the
first tentative experiment in civil government in Oregon. In after years, a son
Joachim came from New Mexico, and laid successful claim to the property, which
was paid by the state.

<p>The Mexicans seem the legitimate descendants of the
subjects of 'His Most Catholic Majesty;' for the Romish
faith is not only the religion established by law, but the only
one tolerated by the constitution: a system of republican
liberty wholly incomprehensible to the independent and
tolerant spirits of the United States. Foreigners only of
other creeds, in accordance with treaty stipulations, can
worship privately within their own houses.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The Mexicans,
indeed, talk of a 'union of Church and State:' they should
rather say a 'union of Church and Army;' for, as has {246}
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg038"></a>[p038]</span> already been shown, the civil authority is so nearly merged
in the military and the ecclesiastical, that the government,
if not a military hierarchy, is something so near akin that it is
difficult to draw the distinction. As Mr. Mayer<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> very
appropriately remarks, you are warned of the double
dominion of the army and the church "by the constant sound
of the drum and the bell, which ring in your ears from morn
to midnight, and drown the sounds of industry and labor."</p>

<p>In the variety and grossness of popular superstitions,
Northern Mexico can probably compete with any civilized
country in the world. Others may have their extravagant
traditions, their fanatical prejudices, their priestly impostures,
but here the popular creed seems to be the embodiment of as
much that is fantastic and improbable in idolatrous worship,
as it is possible to clothe in the garb of a religious faith.
It would fill volumes to relate one-half of the wonderful
miracles and extraordinary apparitions said to have occurred
during and since the conquest of the Indian Pueblos and
their conversion to the Romish faith. Their character
may be inferred from the following national legend of <cite>La
Maravillosa Aparicion de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe</cite>—<i>anglicè</i>,
the marvellous apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe,—which,
in some one of its many traditionary shapes,
is generally believed throughout the republic. I have seen
some half a dozen written versions of this celebrated tradition,
and heard about as many oral {247} ones; but no two
agree in all the particulars. However, that which has
received most currency informs us, that, on the 12th of
December, 1531, an Indian called Juan Diego, while passing
over the barren hill of Tepeyacac (about a league northward <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg039"></a>[p039]</span>
from the city of Mexico), in quest of medicinal herbs, had
his attention suddenly arrested by the fragrance of flowers,
and the sound of delightful music; and on looking up, he
saw an angelic sort of figure directly before him. Being
terrified he attempted to flee; but the apparition calling
to him by name, "Juan Diego," said she, "go tell the bishop
to have me a place of worship erected on this very spot."
The Indian replied that he could not return, as he was
seeking <i>remedios</i> for a dying relative. But the figure bade
him to do as commanded, and have no further care about
his relative—that he was then well. Juan Diego went
to the city, but being unable to procure an audience from the
bishop, he concluded he had been acting under a delusion,
and again set off for his <i>remedios</i>. Upon ascending the
same hill, however, the apparition again accosted him, and
hearing his excuse, upbraided him for his want of faith and
energy; and said, "Tell the bishop that it is Guadalupe, the
Virgin Mary, come to dwell amongst and protect the Mexicans,
who sends thee." The Indian, returning again to the
city, forced his way into the presence of the bishop, who,
like a good sensible man, received the messenger with jeers,
and treated him as a maniac; {248} telling him finally to
bring some sign, which, if really the Mother of God, his
directress could readily furnish.</p>

<p>The perplexed Indian left the bishop's presence resolved
to avoid further molestation from his spiritual acquaintance,
by taking another route; yet, when near the place of his first
meeting, he again encountered the apparition, who, hearing
the result of his mission, ordered him to climb a naked rock
hard by, and collect a bouquet of flowers which he would
find growing there. Juan Diego, albeit without faith,
obeyed, when, to his surprise he found the flowers referred
to, and brought them to the Virgin, who, throwing them into
his <i>tilma</i>, commanded him to carry them to the bishop; saying,
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg040"></a>[p040]</span>
"When he sees these he will believe, as he well knows
that flowers do not bloom at this season, much less upon that
barren rock." The humble messenger now with more courage
sought the bishop's presence, and threw out the blooming
credentials of his mission before him; when lo! to the
astonishment of all, and to the entire conviction of his
<i>Senoría ilustrísima</i>, the perfect image of the apparition
appeared imprinted on the inside of the <i>tilma</i>.<a
name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The reverend Prelate now fully acknowledged the divinity
of the picture, and in a {249} conclave of ecclesiastics convened
for the purpose, he pronounced it the image of <i>La
verdadera Vírgen</i> and protectress of Mexico. A splendid
chapel was soon after erected upon the spot designated in
the mandate, in which the miraculous painting was deposited,
where it is preserved to the present day. In the suburbs of
every principal city in the republic, there is now a chapel
specially dedicated to <i>Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe</i>, where
coarse resemblances of the original picture are to be seen.
Rough paintings of the same, of various dimensions, are
also to be met with in nearly every dwelling, from the palace
to the most miserable hovel. The image, with an adapted <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg041"></a>[p041]</span>
motto, has also been stamped upon medals, which are swung
about the necks of the faithful.<a name="FNanchor_14_14"

</div>

<p>{250} As a further confirmation of the miracle, it is also
told, that when Juan Diego returned to his home, he found
his relative in good health—that he had suddenly risen
from the last extremity about the time of the former's meeting
with the Virgin.</p>

<p>Now comes the profane version of the story, which the
skeptical have set afloat, as the most reasonable one; but
against which, in the name of orthodoxy, I feel bound to
enter my protest. To the better understanding of this
'explanatory tradition,' it may be necessary to premise that
the name of Guadalupe was already familiar to the Spaniards,
the Virgin Mary having, it is said, long before appeared in
Spain, under the same title; on which occasion an order of
monks, styled <dfn>Frailes Guadalupanos</dfn>, had been instituted.
One of these worthy fathers who had been sent as a missionary
to Mexico, finding the Indians rather stubborn and
unyielding, conceived the plan of flattering their national
vanity by fabricating a saint suited for the occasion. The
Guadalupano had a poor friend who was an excellent
painter, to whom he said, one day, "Take this tilma"—presenting
him one of the coarsest and most slazy texture
{251} (a sort of <dfn>manta de guangoche</dfn>); "paste it upon canvass,
and paint me thereon the handsomest effigy of Nuestra
Señora de Guadalupe that your fancy can portray." When <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg042"></a>[p042]</span>
this was done according to order, and the tilma separated
from the canvass, the picture appeared somewhat miraculous.
Viewed very closely, it showed exceedingly dim; but upon
receding to some distance, so that the eye could embrace a
larger field of the open texture, it appeared quite distinct
and beautiful. This effect is often alluded to at the present
day, and easily as it might be accounted for upon philosophical
principles, I have heard many an ignorant Mexican
declare, that <i>la Santisima Vírgen</i> concealed herself from
such as profaned her shrine by a too near approach, and
only shone forth in all her brilliancy to those who kept at a
respectful distance. But in conclusion, the story relates,
that a suitable damsel being selected and decked out to
represent the Virgin, the affair was played off as it has been
narrated.</p>

<p>As regards the miracle of the fresh flowers in December
the <i>profanos</i> say, that there was nothing very wonderful about
it, as flowers were known to bloom in the lowlands, and
only a few leagues from the spot where the affair took place,
at all seasons of the year; implying that these had been
engrafted upon the rock for the occasion. There are some
who go so far as to insinuate that the bishop and other
ecclesiastics were privy to the whole affair, and that every
precaution had been {252} taken to see the Indian who
played first fiddle in the matter, provided with a tilma,
similar to the one on which the image of the Virgin was
painted, and that this was artfully slipped in the place of the
former, which the Indian had doffed when he climbed the
rock after the flowers.—I have not seen the original portrait,
but most of the copies and imitations I have met with,
represent the Virgin with that peculiarly tawny complexion
which was probably deemed indispensable to conciliate the
prejudices of the aborigines. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg043"></a>[p043]</span></p>

<p>The reader may reconcile the foregoing discrepancies in
the best way he can; all that I have to add is, that the
apparition having been canonized by the Pope, a belief in it
now constitutes as much a part of the religious faith of the
Mexicans, as any article of the Apostolic Creed. To judge
from the blind and reverential awe in which the Virgin
Guadalupe is held by the lowly and the ignorant, one
would suppose her to be the first person in the Divinity,
for to her their vows are directed, their prayers offered up,
and all their confessions made.</p>

<p>Among the many traditions implicitly believed in by the
people, and which tend to obstruct the advancement of
knowledge, there is one equally as amusing and extravagant
as the foregoing, which has been gravely recounted by the
present Vicar of New Mexico and ex-delegate to Congress.
During the memorable insurrection of 1680, the Pueblo of
San Felipe was about the only one that {253} remained faithful
to the Spaniards in all the North. It was during that
exciting period that the padre of another Pueblo took refuge
among them. Being besieged by their neighbors and their
communication with the water entirely cut off, they applied
for advice to the reverend padre, who bade them not despair,
as he had it in his power to supply them with water. He
then began to pray very fervently, after which he opened a
vein in each of his arms, from whence there flowed two such
copious streams of water that all fears of being reduced by

<p>It is a part of the superstitious blindness of these people
to believe that every one of their legion of canonized saints
possesses the power of performing certain miracles; and their
aid is generally invoked on all occasions of sickness and
distress. The kindest office, therefore, that the friends
of a sick person can perform, is to bring forward the image
of some of those saints whose healing powers have been
satisfactorily tested. The efficacy of these superstitious
remedies will not be difficult to account for, when the
powerful influence of the imagination upon disease is taken
into consideration.</p>

<p>The images of patron saints are never put in such general
requisition, however, as in seasons of severe drought. The
priests, being generally expert at guessing the approach
of a pluvial period, take good care not to make confident
promises till they have substantial {254} reason to anticipate
a speedy fulfilment of their prophecies. When the fitting
season draws nigh, they carry out the image of Nuestra
Señora de Guadalupe, or that of some other favorite saint,
and parade about the streets, the fields and the meadows,
followed by all the men, women, and children of the neighborhood,
in solemn procession. Should the clouds condescend
to vouchsafe a supply of rain within a week or
two of this general humiliation, no one ever thinks of begrudging
the scores of dollars that have been paid to the
priests for bringing about so happy a result.</p>

<p>Speaking of processions, I am reminded of another
peculiar custom so prevalent in Mexico, that it never
fails to attract the attention of strangers. This is the
passage of the Sacred Host to the residence of persons
dangerously ill, for the purpose of administering to them
the Extreme Unction. In New Mexico, however, this
procession is not attended with so much ostentatious display
as it is in the South, the paradise of ecclesiastics, where <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg045"></a>[p045]</span>
it is conveyed in a black coach drawn by a pair of black
mules, accompanied by armed soldiers and followed by
crowds of <i>léperos</i> of all sexes and ages. During the procession
of the Host, two church-bells of different tones are
kept sounding by alternate strokes. Also the carriage
is always preceded by a bell-man tinkling a little bell in
regular time, to notify all within hearing of its approach,
that they may be prepared to pay it due homage. When
{255} this bell is heard, all those that happen to be within
sight of the procession, though at ever so great a distance,
instantly kneel and remain in that position till it has passed
out of sight. On these occasions, if an American happens
to be within hearing, he endeavors to avoid the <i>cortége</i>,
by turning the corner of a street or entering a shop or the
house of a friend; for although it may be expedient, and
even rational, to conform with the customs and ceremonies
of these countries we are sojourning in, very few Protestants
would feel disposed to fall on their knees before a coach
freighted with frail mortals pretending to represent the
Godhead! I am sorry to say that non-compliants are
frequently insulted and sometimes pelted with stones by
the rabble. Even a foreign artisan was once massacred
in the Mexican metropolis because he refused to come out
of his shop, where he was kneeling, and perform the act
of genuflexion in the street!</p>

<p>This abject idolatry sometimes takes a still more humiliating
aspect, and descends to the worship of men in the
capacity of religious rulers. On the occasion of the Bishop
of Durango's visit to Santa Fé in 1833, an event which
had not taken place for a great many years, the infatuated
population hailed his arrival with as much devotional
enthusiasm as if it had been the second advent of the Messiah.
Magnificent preparations were made everywhere
for his reception: the streets were swept, the roads and <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg046"></a>[p046]</span>
bridges on his route repaired {256} and decorated; and
from every window in the city there hung such a profusion
of fancy curtains and rich cloths that the imagination was
carried back to those glowing descriptions of enchanted
worlds which one reads of in the fables of necromancers.
I must observe, however, that there is a custom in all the
towns of Mexico (which it would not be safe to neglect),
providing that whenever a religious procession takes place,
all the doors and windows facing the street along which it
is to pass, shall be decorated with shawls, carpets, or fancy
cloths, according to the means and capabilities of the proprietor.
During the bishop's sojourn in Santa Fé, which,
to the great joy of the inhabitants, lasted for several weeks,
he never appeared in the streets but that 'all true Catholics'
who were so fortunate as to obtain a glimpse of his <i>Señoría
Ilustrísima</i> immediately dropped upon their knees, and
never moved from that position till the mitred priest had
either vouchsafed his benediction or had disappeared. Even
the principal personages of the city would not venture to
address him till they had first knelt at his feet and kissed
his 'pastoral ring.' This, however, is only a heightened
picture of what occurs every day in the intercourse between
the rancheros and the common padres of the country. The
slavish obsequiousness of the lower classes towards these
pampered priests is almost incredible.</p>

<p>No people are more punctual in their attendance upon
public worship, or more exact {257} in the performance of
the external rites of religion, than the New Mexicans. A
man would about as soon think of venturing in twenty
fathoms of water without being able to swim, as of undertaking
a journey without hearing mass first. These religious
exercises, however, partake but seldom of the character
of true devotion; for people may be seen chattering
or tittering while in the act of crossing themselves, or muttering <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg047"></a>[p047]</span>
some formal prayer. Indeed, it is the common
remark of strangers, that they are wont to wear much
graver countenances while dancing at a fandango than
during their devotional exercises at the foot of the altar.
In nothing, however, is their observance of the outward
forms of religion more remarkable than in their deportment
every day towards the close of twilight, when the large bell
of the <i>Parroquia</i> peals for <i>la oracion</i>, or vespers.<a
name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> All
conversation is instantly suspended—all labor ceases—people
of all classes, whether on foot or on horseback, make
a sudden halt—even the laden porter, groaning under
the weight of an insupportable burden, stops in the midst
of his career and stands still. An almost breathless silence
reigns throughout the town, disturbed only by the occasional
sibilations of the devout multitude: all of which, accompanied
by the slow heavy peals of a large sonorous bell,
afford a scene truly solemn and appropriate. At the expiration
of about two minutes the charm is suddenly broken
by the clatter of livelier-toned bells; and a <dfn>buenas {258}
tardes</dfn> (good evening) to those present closes the ceremony:
when <i>presto</i>, all is bustle and confusion again—the colloquial
chit-chat is resumed—the smith plies upon his
anvil with redoubled energy—the clink of the hammer
simultaneously resounds in every direction—the wayfarers
are again in motion,—both pleasure and business, in
short, assume their respective sway.</p>

<p>Although the Catholics have a saint for each day in the
year, the number of canonized <i>fiestas</i> in which labor is prohibited
has been somewhat reduced in Mexico. <dfn>La Semana
Santa</dfn>, or Passion Week, is perhaps the period when
the religious feeling, such as it is, is most fully excited: <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg048"></a>[p048]</span>
<dfn>Viernes Santo</dfn> (Good Friday), especially, is observed with
great pomp and splendor. An image of Christ large as
life, nailed to a huge wooden cross, is paraded through
the streets, in the midst of an immense procession, accompanied
by a glittering array of carved images, representing
the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene, and several others;
while the most notorious personages of antiquity, who
figured at that great era of the World's history,—the centurion
with a band of guards, armed with lances, and apparelled
in the costume supposed to have been worn in
those days,—may be seen bestriding splendidly caparisoned
horses, in the breathing reality of flesh and blood. Taking
it all in all, this spectacle,—the ceremonies and manœuvres
which attend its career through the densely crowded and
ornamented {259} streets,—are calculated to produce impressions
of a most confused description, in which regret and
melancholy may be said to form no inconsiderable share.</p>

<p>It has been customary for great malefactors to propitiate
Divine forgiveness by a cruel sort of <i>penitencia</i>, which
generally takes place during the <i>Semana Santa</i>. I once
chanced to be in the town of Tomé<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> on Good Friday,
when my attention was arrested by a man almost naked,
bearing, in imitation of Simon, a huge cross upon his shoulders,
which, though constructed of the lightest wood, must
have weighed over a hundred pounds. The long end
dragged upon the ground, as we have seen it represented
in sacred pictures, and about the middle swung a stone of
immense dimensions, appended there for the purpose of
making the task more laborious. Not far behind followed
another equally destitute of clothing, with his whole body
wrapped in chains and cords, which seemed buried in the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg049"></a>[p049]</span>
muscles, and which so cramped and confined him that
he was scarcely able to keep pace with the procession.
The person who brought up the rear presented a still more
disgusting aspect. He walked along with a patient and
composed step, while another followed close behind belaboring
him lustily with a whip, which he flourished with
all the satisfaction of an amateur; but as the lash was pointed
only with a tuft of untwisted sea-grass, its application merely
served to keep open the wounds upon the penitent's {260}
back, which had been scarified, as I was informed, with
the keen edge of a flint, and was bleeding most profusely.
The blood was kept in perpetual flow by the stimulating
juice of certain herbs, carried by a third person, into which
the scourger frequently dipped his lash. Although the
actors in this tragical farce were completely muffled, yet
they were well known to many of the by-standers, one of
whom assured me that they were three of the most notorious
rascals in the country. By submitting to this species of
penance, they annually received complete absolution of
their past year's sins, and, thus 'purified,' entered afresh
on the old career of wickedness and crime.</p>

<p>In New Mexico, the institution of marriage changes the
legal rights of the parties, but it scarcely affects their moral
obligations. It is usually looked upon as a convenient
cloak for irregularities, which society less willingly tolerates
in the lives of unmarried women. Yet when it is considered
that the majority of matches are forced and ill-assorted,
some idea may be formed of the little incitement that is
given to virtue. There are very few parents who would
stoop to consult a young lady's wishes before concluding
a marriage contract, nor would maidens, generally, ever
dream of a matrimonial connection unless proposed first
by the father. The lover's proposals are, upon the same
principle, made in writing direct to the parents themselves, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg050"></a>[p050]</span>
and without the least deference to the wishes or inclinations
{261} of the young lady whose hand is thus sought in marriage.
The tender emotions engendered between lovers
during walks and rambles along the banks of silent streams,
are never experienced in this country; for the sexes are
seldom permitted to converse or be together alone. In
short, instances have actually occurred when the betrothed
couple have never seen each other till brought to the altar
to be joined in wedlock.</p>

<p>Among the humbler classes, there are still more powerful
causes calculated to produce irregularity of life; not the
least of which is the enormous fee that must be paid to the
curate for tying the matrimonial knot. This system of
extortion is carried so far as to amount very frequently
to absolute prohibition: for the means of the bridegroom
are often insufficient for the exigency of the occasion; and
the priests seldom consent to join people in wedlock until
the money has been secured to them. The curates being
without control, the marriage rates are somewhat irregular,
but they usually increase in proportion to the character
of the ceremonies and to the circumstances of the parties.
The lowest (about twenty dollars) are adapted to the simplest
form, solemnized in church at mass; but with the
excuse of any extra service and ceremonies, particularly
if performed at a private house, the fees are increased often
as high as several hundred dollars: I have heard of $500
being paid for a marriage ceremony. The following communication,
which {262} appeared in a Chihuahua paper
under the signature of "<i>Un Ranchero</i>" affords some illustration
of the grievances of the plebeians in this respect.
Literally translated it runs thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<em>Messrs. Editors of the Noticioso de Chihuahua:</em></p>

<p>"Permit me, through your paper, to say a few words in
print, as those of my pen have been unsuccessfully employed
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg051"></a>[p051]</span> with the <i>curas</i> of Allende and Jimenez, to whom I
applied the other day for the purpose of ascertaining their
legal charge to marry one of my sons. The following
simple and concise answer is all that I have been able to
elicit from either of these ecclesiastics:—'<em>The marriage
fees are a hundred and nineteen dollars</em>.' I must confess
that I was completely suffocated when I heard this outrageous
demand upon my poor purse; and did I not pride
myself on being a true Apostolic Roman Catholic, and
were it not that the charming graces of my intended daughter-in-law
have so captivated my son that nothing but marriage
will satisfy him, I would assuredly advise him to contrive
some other arrangement with his beloved, which
might not be so ruinous to our poor purse; for reflect that
$119 are the life and all of a poor ranchero. If nothing
else will do, I shall have to sell my few cows (<dfn>mis vaquitas</dfn>)
to help my son out of this difficulty."—The 'Ranchero'
then appeals to the Government to remedy such evils, by
imposing some salutary restrictions upon the clergy; and
concludes by saying, "If this is not done, I will {263} never
permit either of my remaining three sons to marry."</p></div>

<p>This article was certainly an effort of boldness against
the priesthood, which may have cost the poor 'Ranchero'
a sentence of ex-communication. Few of his countrymen
would venture on a similar act of temerity; and at least
nine-tenths profess the most profound submission to their
religious rulers. Being thus bred to look upon their
priests as infallible and holy samples of piety and virtue,
we should not be so much surprised at the excesses of the
'flock' when a large portion of the <i>pastores</i>, the padres
themselves, are foremost in most of the popular vices of
the country: first at the fandango—first at the gaming
table—first at the cock-pit—first at bacchanalian orgies—and <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg052"></a>[p052]</span>
by no means last in the contraction of those
<i>liaisons</i> which are so emphatically prohibited by their
vows.</p>

<p>The baptismal and burial fees (neither of which can be
avoided without incurring the charge of heresy) are also
a great terror to the candidates for married life. "If I
marry," says the poor yeoman, "my family must go unclad
to baptize my children; and if any of them should die,
we must starve ourselves to pay the burial charges."
The fee for baptism, it is true, is not so exorbitant,
and in accordance to custom, is often paid by the <dfn>padrino</dfn>
or sponsor; but the burial costs are almost equally extravagant
with those of marriage, varying in proportion to the
age and {264} circumstances of the deceased. A faithful
Mexican servant in my employ at Chihuahua, once solicited
forty dollars to bury his mother. Upon my expressing
some surprise at the exorbitancy of the amount, he replied—"That
is what the cura demands, sir, and if I do not
pay it my poor mother will remain unburied!" Thus this
man was obliged to sacrifice several months' wages, to
pamper the avarice of a vicious and mercenary priest. On
another occasion, a poor widow in Santa Fé, begged a little
medicine for her sick child: "Not," said the disconsolate
mother, "that the life of the babe imports me much, for I
know the <i>angelito</i> will go directly to heaven; but what shall
I do to pay the priest for burying it? He will take my
house and all from me—and I shall be turned desolate
into the street!"—and so saying, she commenced weeping
bitterly.</p>

<p>Indigent parents are thus frequently under the painful
necessity of abandoning and disowning their deceased children,
to avoid the responsibility of burial expenses. To
this end the corpse is sometimes deposited in some niche
or corner of the church during the night; and upon being <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg053"></a>[p053]</span>
found in the morning, the priest is bound to inter it gratis,
unless the parent can be discovered, in which case the latter
would be liable to severe castigation, besides being bound
to pay the expenses.</p>

<p>Children that have not been baptized are destined, according
to the popular faith, to a kind of negative existence in the
world of {265} spirits, called <dfn>Limbo</dfn>, where they remain for ever
without either suffering punishment or enjoying happiness.
Baptized infants, on the other hand, being considered without
sin, are supposed to enter at once into the joys of heaven.
The deceased child is then denominated an <dfn>angelito</dfn> (a little
angel), and is interred with joy and mirth instead of grief
and wailing. It is gaudily bedecked with fanciful attire
and ornaments of tinsel and flowers; and being placed upon
a small bier, it is carried to the grave by four children as
gaily dressed as their circumstances will allow; accompanied
by musicians using the instruments and playing the
tunes of the fandangos; and the little procession is nothing
but glee and merriment.</p>

<p>In New Mexico the lower classes are very rarely, if ever,
buried in coffins: the corpse being simply wrapped in a
blanket, or some other covering, and in that rude attire
consigned to its last home. It is truly shocking to a sensitive
mind to witness the inhuman treatment to which the
remains of the dead are sometimes subjected. There being
nothing to indicate the place of the previous graves, it not
unfrequently happens that the partially decayed relics of a
corpse are dug up and forced to give place to the more
recently deceased, when they are again thrown with the
earth into the new grave with perfect indifference. The
operation of filling up the grave especially, is particularly
repulsive; the earth being pounded down with a large maul,
{266} as fast as it is thrown in upon the unprotected corpse,
with a force sufficient to crush a delicate frame to atoms. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg054"></a>[p054]</span></p>

<p>As the remains of heretics are not permitted to pollute
either the church-yard or <i>Campo Santo</i>, those Americans
who have died in Santa Fé, have been buried on a hill which
overlooks the town to the northward. The corpses have
sometimes been disinterred and robbed of the shroud in
which they were enveloped; so that, on a few occasions, it
has been deemed expedient to appoint a special watch for
the protection of the grave.</p>

The accompanying cut represents both sides of a medal of "<dfn>Nuestra Señora
de Guadalupe de Mexico</dfn>," of which, as I have been informed, 216,000 were struck
at Birmingham in the year 1831, designed for the Mexican market. Similar medals
are worn by nearly nine-tenths of the population of Northern Mexico. On one
side, as will be seen, the Virgin is represented in her star-spangled robe, supported
by a cherub and the moon under her feet: a design, which, it has been suggested,
was most probably drawn from Revelation xii. 1. The date, "A. 1805," is that
perhaps of some one of the innumerable miracles, which, according to fame in
Mexico, have been wrought by the Virgin Guadalupe. The motto, "<i>Non fecit
taliter omni nationi</i>" (She "hath not dealt so with any nation") which is found on
the reverse of the medal, is extracted from Psalm cxlvii. 20.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span></p></div>

<p>Allusion has so frequently been made to the aboriginal
tribes of New Mexico, known as <dfn>Los Pueblos</dfn>, that I think
I shall not be trespassing too much upon the patience of
the reader, in glancing rapidly at some of the more conspicuous
features of their national habits and character.</p>

<p>Although the term <dfn>Pueblo</dfn> in Spanish literally means
the <i>people</i>, and their <i>towns</i>, it is here specifically applied
to the <i>Christianized Indians</i> (as well as their villages)—to
those aborigines whom the Spaniards not only subjected
to their laws, but to an acknowledgment of the Romish
faith, and upon whom they forced baptism and the cross
in exchange for {268} the vast possessions of which they
robbed them. All that was left them was, to each Pueblo
a league or two of land situated around their villages, the
conquerors reserving to themselves at least ninety-nine
hundredths of the whole domain as a requital for their
generosity. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg055"></a>[p055]</span></p>

<p>When these regions were first discovered it appears that
the inhabitants lived in comfortable houses and cultivated
the soil, as they have continued to do up to the present
time. Indeed, they are now considered the best horticulturists
in the country, furnishing most of the fruits and
a large portion of the vegetable supplies that are to be found
in the markets. They were until very lately the only
people in New Mexico who cultivated the grape. They
also maintain at the present time considerable herds of
cattle, horses, etc. They are, in short, a remarkably sober
and industrious race, conspicuous for morality and honesty,
and very little given to quarrelling or dissipation, except
when they have had much familiar intercourse with the
Hispano-Mexican population.</p>

<p>Most of these Pueblos call themselves the descendants
of Montezuma, although it would appear that they could
only have been made acquainted with the history of that
monarch, by the Spaniards; as this province is nearly two
thousand miles from the ancient kingdom of Mexico. At
the time of the conquest they must have been a very powerful
people—numbering near a hundred villages, as existing
{269} ruins would seem to indicate; but they are now reduced
to about twenty, which are scattered in various parts of
the territory.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a
href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>There are but three or four different languages spoken
among them, and these, indeed, may be distantly allied
to each other. Those of Taos, Picuris, Isleta, and perhaps
some others, speak what has been called the <dfn>Piro</dfn> language.
A large portion of the others, viz., those of San Juan, Santa <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg056"></a>[p056]</span>
Clara, Nambé, Pojuaque, Tezuque, and some others,
speak <dfn>Tegua</dfn>, having all been originally known by this
general name; and those of Cochití, Santo Domingo, San
Felipe, and perhaps Sandía, speak the same tongue, though
they seem formerly to have been distinguished as <dfn>Queres</dfn>.
The numerous tribes that inhabited the highlands between
Rio del Norte and Pecos, as those of Pecos, Ciénega, Galisteo,
etc., were known anciently as <dfn>Tagnos</dfn>, but these are now
all extinct; yet their language is said to be spoken by those
of Jemez and others of that section. Those further to
the westward<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a
href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> {270} are perhaps allied to the Navajoes.
Though all these Pueblos speak their native languages
among themselves, a great many of them possess a smattering
of Spanish, sufficient to carry on their intercourse with
the Mexicans.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The population of these Pueblos will average nearly
five hundred souls each (though some hardly exceed one
hundred), making an aggregate of nine or ten thousand.
At the time of the original conquest, at the close of the
sixteenth century, they were, as has been mentioned, much, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg057"></a>[p057]</span>
perhaps ten-fold, more numerous.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Ancient ruins are
now to be seen scattered in every quarter of the territory:
of some, entire stone walls are yet standing, while others
are nearly or quite obliterated, many of them being now
only known by their names which history or tradition has
preserved to us. Numbers were no doubt destroyed during
the insurrection of 1680, and the petty internal strifes which
followed.</p>

<p>Several of these Pueblos have been converted into Mexican
villages, of which that of <dfn>Pecos</dfn> is perhaps the most
remarkable instance. What with the massacres of the
second conquest, and the inroads of the Comanches, they
gradually dwindled away, till they found themselves reduced
to about a dozen, comprising all ages and sexes; and
it was only a few years ago that they abandoned the home
of their fathers and joined the Pueblo of Jemez.</p>

<p>Many curious tales are told of the singular habits of this
ill-fated tribe, which must no {271} doubt have tended to
hasten its utter annihilation. A tradition was prevalent
among them that Montezuma had kindled a holy fire, and
enjoined their ancestors not to suffer it to be extinguished
until he should return to deliver his people from the yoke
of the Spaniards. In pursuance of these commands, a
constant watch had been maintained for ages to prevent
the fire from going out; and, as tradition further informed
them, that Montezuma would appear with the sun, the
deluded Indians were to be seen every clear morning upon
the terraced roofs of their houses, attentively watching for
the appearance of the 'king of light,' in hopes of seeing
him 'cheek by jowl' with their immortal sovereign. I have <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg058"></a>[p058]</span>
myself descended into the famous <dfn>estufas</dfn>, or subterranean
vaults, of which there were several in the village, and have
beheld this consecrated fire, silently smouldering under a
covering of ashes, in the basin of a small altar. Some
say that they never lost hope in the final coming of
Montezuma until, by some accident or other, or a lack
of a sufficiency of warriors to watch it, the fire became
extinguished; and that it was this catastrophe that induced
them to abandon their villages, as I have before observed.</p>

<p>The task of tending the sacred fire was, it is said, allotted
to the warriors. It is further related, that they took the
watch by turns for two successive days and nights, without
partaking of either food, water, or sleep; while some assert,
that instead of being restricted to {272} two days, each
guard continued with the same unbending severity of purpose
until exhaustion, and very frequently death, left their places
to be filled by others. A large portion of those who came
out alive were generally so completely prostrated by the
want of repose and the inhalation of carbonic gas that they
very soon died; when, as the vulgar story asseverates, their
remains were carried to the den of a monstrous serpent,
which kept itself in excellent condition by feeding upon
these delicacies. This huge snake (invented no doubt by
the lovers of the marvellous to account for the constant
disappearance of the Indians) was represented as the idol
which they worshipped, and as subsisting entirely upon
the flesh of his devotees: live infants, however, seemed
to suit his palate best. The story of this wonderful serpent
was so firmly believed in by many ignorant people, that on
one occasion I heard an honest ranchero assert, that upon
entering the village very early on a winter's morning, he
saw the huge trail of the reptile in the snow, as large as that
of a dragging ox. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg059"></a>[p059]</span></p>

<p>This village, anciently so renowned, lies twenty-five
miles eastward of Santa Fé, and near the <i>Rio Pecos</i>, to
which it gave name. Even so late as ten years ago, when
it contained a population of fifty to a hundred souls, the
traveller would oftentimes perceive but a solitary Indian,
a woman, or a child, standing here and there like so many
statues upon the roofs of their houses, with their eyes fixed
on {273} the eastern horizon, or leaning against a wall or
a fence, listlessly gazing at the passing stranger; while at
other times not a soul was to be seen in any direction, and
the sepulchral silence of the place was only disturbed by
the occasional barking of a dog, or the cackling of hens.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>No other Pueblo appears to have adopted this extraordinary
superstition: like Pecos, however, they have all
held Montezuma to be their perpetual sovereign. It would
likewise appear that they all worship the sun; for it is
asserted to be their regular practice to turn the face
towards the east at sunrise.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> They profess the Catholic
faith, however, of which, nevertheless, they cannot be expected
to understand anything beyond the formalities; as <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg060"></a>[p060]</span>
but very few of their Mexican neighbors and teachers
can boast of more.</p>

<p>Although nominally under the jurisdiction of the federal
government, as Mexican citizens, many features of their
ancient customs are still retained, as well in their civil rule
as in their religion. Each Pueblo is under the control of a
<dfn>cacique</dfn> or <dfn>gobernadorcillo</dfn>, chosen from among their own
sages, and commissioned by the governor of New Mexico.
The cacique, when any public business is to be transacted,
collects together the principal chiefs of the Pueblo in an
<dfn>estufa</dfn>, or cell, usually under ground, and there lays before
them the subjects of debate, which are generally settled
by the opinion of the majority. No Mexican is admitted
to these councils, nor do the {274} subjects of discussion
ever transpire beyond the precincts of the cavern. The
council has also charge of the interior police and tranquility
of the village.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> One of their regulations is to appoint
a secret watch for the purpose of keeping down disorders
and vices of every description, and especially to keep
an eye over the young men and women of the village. When
any improper intercourse among them is detected, the
parties are immediately carried to the council, and the
cacique intimates to them that they must be wedded forthwith.
Should the girl be of bad character, and the man, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg061"></a>[p061]</span>
therefore, unwilling to marry her, they are ordered to
keep separate under penalty of the lash. Hence it is, that
the females of these Pueblos are almost universally noted
for their chastity and modest deportment.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>They also elect a <dfn>capitan de guerra</dfn>, a kind of commander-in-chief
of the warriors, whose office it is to
defend their homes and their interests both in the field
and in the council chamber.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Though not very warlike,
these Pueblos are generally valiant, and well skilled
in the strategies of Indian warfare; and although they
have been branded with cruelty and ferocity, yet they
can hardly be said to surpass the Mexicans in this respect:
both, in times of war, pay but little regard either to age or
sex. I have been told that when the Pueblos return from
their belligerent expeditions, instead of going directly to
their homes, they always visit their council cell first. Here
{275} they undress, dance, and carouse, frequently for two
days in succession before seeing their families.</p>

<p>Although the Pueblos are famous for hospitality and
industry, they still continue in the rudest state of ignorance,
having neither books nor schools among them, as none of
their languages have been reduced to rules, and very few
of their children are ever taught in Spanish.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> A degree of
primitiveness characterizes all their amusements, which
bear a strong similarity to those of the wilder tribes. Before
the New Mexican government had become so much <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg062"></a>[p062]</span>
impoverished, there was wont to be held in the capital on
the 16th of September of every year, a national celebration
of the declaration of Independence, to which the Pueblos
were invited. The warriors and youths of each nation
with a proportionate array of dusky damsels would appear
on these occasions, painted and ornamented in accordance
with their aboriginal customs, and amuse the inhabitants
with all sorts of grotesque feats and native dances. Each
Pueblo generally had its particular uniform dress and its
particular dance. The men of one village would sometimes
disguise themselves as elks, with horns on their heads,
moving on all-fours, and mimicking the animal they were
attempting to personate. Others would appear in the
garb of a turkey, with large heavy wings, and strut about
in imitation of that bird. But the Pecos tribe, already
reduced to seven men, always occasioned most diversion.
{276} Their favorite exploit was, each to put on the skin
of a buffalo, horns, tail, and all, and thus accoutred scamper
about through the crowd, to the real or affected terror
of all the ladies present, and to the great delight of the
boys.</p>

<p>The Pueblo villages are generally built with more regularity
than those of the Mexicans, and are constructed of
the same materials as were used by them in the most primitive
ages. Their dwelling-houses, it is true, are not so
spacious as those of the Mexicans, containing very seldom
more than two or three small apartments upon the ground
floor, without any court-yard, but they have generally a
much loftier appearance, being frequently two stories high
and sometimes more. A very curious feature in these
buildings, is, that there is most generally no direct communication
between the street and the lower rooms, into which
they descend by a trap-door from the upper story, the latter
being accessible by means of ladders. Even the entrance
to the upper stories is frequently at the roof. This style of <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg063"></a>[p063]</span>
building seems to have been adopted for security against
their marauding neighbors of the wilder tribes, with whom
they were often at war. When the family had all been
housed at night, the ladder was drawn up, and the inmates
were thus shut up in a kind of fortress, which bid defiance
to the scanty implements of warfare used by the wild Indians.</p>

<p>Though this was their most usual style of architecture,
there still exists a Pueblo of Taos, {277} composed, for the
most part, of but two edifices of very singular structure—one
on each side of a creek, and formerly communicating
by a bridge. The base-story is a mass of near four hundred
feet long, a hundred and fifty wide, and divided into numerous
apartments, upon which other tiers of rooms are built,
one above another, drawn in by regular grades, forming
a pyramidal pile of fifty or sixty feet high, and comprising
some six or eight stories. The outer rooms only seem to
be used for dwellings, and are lighted by little windows
in the sides, but are entered through trap-doors in the
<dfn>azoteas</dfn> or roofs. Most of the inner apartments are employed
as granaries and store-rooms, but a spacious hall in
the centre of the mass, known as the <dfn>estufa</dfn>, is reserved for
their secret councils. These two buildings afford habitations,
as is said, for over six hundred souls.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> There is
likewise an edifice in the Pueblo of Picuris<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> of the same
class, and some of those of Moqui are also said to be similar.</p>

<p>Some of these villages were built upon rocky eminences
deemed almost inaccessible: witness for instance <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg064"></a>[p064]</span>
the ruins of the ancient Pueblo of San Felipe, which
may be seen towering upon the very verge of a precipice
several hundred feet high, whose base is washed by
the swift current of the Rio del Norte. The still existing
Pueblo of Acoma also stands upon an isolated mound
whose whole area is occupied by the village, being fringed
all around by a precipitous <dfn>ceja</dfn> or cliff. {278} The inhabitants
enter the village by means of ladders, and by steps
cut into the solid rock upon which it is based.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>At the time of the conquest, many of these Pueblos
manufactured some singular textures of cotton and other
materials; but with the loss of their liberty, they seem
to have lost most of their arts and ingenuity; so that the
finer specimens of native fabrics are now only to be met
with among the Moquis and Navajoes, who still retain
their independence. The Pueblos, however, make some
of the ordinary classes of blankets and <dfn>tilmas</dfn>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> as well as
other woolen stuffs. They also manufacture, according
to their aboriginal art, both for their own consumption, and
for the purpose of traffic, a species of earthenware not much
inferior to the coarse crockery of our common potters.
The pots made of this material stand fire remarkably well,
and are the universal substitutes for all the purposes of
cookery, even among the Mexicans, for the iron castings
of this country, which are utterly unknown there. Rude
as this kind of crockery is, it nevertheless evinces a
great deal of skill, considering that it is made entirely <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg065"></a>[p065]</span>
without lathe or any kind of machinery. It is often fancifully
painted with colored earths and the juice of a plant
called <dfn>guaco</dfn>, which brightens by burning. They also
work a singular kind of wicker-ware, of which some bowls
(if they may be so called) are so closely platted, {279} that,
once swollen by dampness, they serve to hold liquids, and
are therefore light and convenient vessels for the purposes
of travellers.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The dress of many of the Pueblos has become assimilated
in some respects to that of the common Mexicans; but by
far the greatest portion still retain most of their aboriginal
costume. The Taosas and others of the north somewhat
resemble the prairie tribes in this respect; but the Pueblos
to the south and west of Santa Fé dress in a different style,
which is said to be similar in many respects to that of the
aboriginal inhabitants of the city of Mexico. The moccasin
is the only part of the prairie suit that appears common
to them all, and of both sexes. They mostly wear
a kind of short breeches and long stockings, the use of
which they most probably acquired from the Spaniards.
The <dfn>saco</dfn>, a species of woollen jacket without sleeves, completes
their exterior garment; except during inclement
seasons, when they make use of the tilma. Very few of
them have hats or head-dress of any kind; and they generally
wear their hair long—commonly fashioned into a <dfn>queue</dfn>,
wrapped with some colored stuff. The squaws of the northern
tribes dress pretty much like those of the Prairies; but
the usual costume of the females of the southern and western
Pueblos is a handsome kind of small blanket of dark color, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg066"></a>[p066]</span>
which is drawn under one arm and tacked over the other
shoulder, leaving both arms free and naked. It is generally
{280} worn with a cotton chemise underneath and is bound
about the waist with a girdle. We rarely if ever see a
thorough-bred Pueblo woman in Mexican dress.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The weapons most in use among the Pueblos are the
bow and arrow, with a long-handled lance and occasionally
a fusil. The rawhide shield is also much used, which,
though of but little service against fire-arms, serves to ward
off the arrow and lance.</p>

<p>The aliment of these Indians is, in most respects, similar
to that of the Mexicans; in fact, as has been elsewhere
remarked, the latter adopted with their utensils numerous
items of aboriginal diet. The <i>tortilla</i>, the <i>atole</i>, the <i>pinole</i>,<a
name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
and many others, together with the use of <i>chile</i>, are from
the Indians. Some of the wilder tribes make a peculiar
kind of <dfn>pinole</dfn>, by grinding the bean of the mezquite tree
into flour, which is then used as that of corn. And besides
the tortilla they make another singular kind of bread, if
we may so style it, called <dfn>guayave</dfn>, a roll of which so much
resembles a 'hornets' nest,' that by strangers it is often
designated by this title. It is usually made of Indian
corn prepared and ground as for tortillas, and diluted into
a thin paste. {281} I once happened to enter an Indian
hut where a young girl of the family was baking <i>guayaves</i>.
She was sitting by a fire, over which a large flat stone was
heating, with a crock of prepared paste by her side. She <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg067"></a>[p067]</span>
thrust her hand into the paste, and then wiped it over the
heated stone. What adhered to it was instantly baked and
peeled off. She repeated this process at the rate of a
dozen times or more per minute. Observing my curiosity,
the girl handed me one of the 'sheets,' silently; for she
seemed to understand but her native tongue. I found
it pleasant enough to the taste; though when cold, as I
have learned by experience, it is, like the cold tortilla,
rather tough and insipid. They are even thinner than
wafers; and some dozens, being folded in a roll, constitute
the laminate composition before mentioned. Being
thus preserved, they serve the natives for months upon
their journeys.</p>

The inhabitants mostly profess the Catholic faith, but have now no curate. They
cultivate the soil, manufacture, and possess considerable quantities of stock. Their
village is over 150 miles west of the Rio del Norte, on the waters of the Colorado
of the West, and is believed to contain between 1,000 and 1,500 souls. The "seven
Pueblos of Moqui" (as they are called) are a similar tribe living a few leagues
beyond. They formerly acknowledged the government and religion of the Spaniards,
but have long since rejected both, and live in a state of independence and
paganism. Their dwellings, however, like those of Zuñi, are similar to those of
the interior Pueblos, and they are equally industrious and agricultural, and still
more ingenious in their manufacturing. The language of the <dfn>Moquis</dfn> or <dfn>Moquinos</dfn>
is said to differ but little from that of the Navajoes.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span>

the close of the seventeenth century had a population of two thousand, being the
largest pueblo in either New Mexico or Arizona. It was visited as early as 1540
by Alvarado, a lieutenant of Coronado. In 1598, the inhabitants rendered submission
to Oñate, and a mission was established among them for which a large
church was built in the seventeenth century, its ruins being still conspicuous. In
the revolt of 1680 the Pecos remained neutral; but soon thereafter decline in numbers
set in, and by 1837 but eighteen adults were left. A fever swept away the
majority of these, when in 1840 the remnant of five men sold their lands to the
government, and retired to their kinsmen at Jemez. A son of the tribe was found
in 1880 among the Mexicans of the village of Pecos, a small, comparatively modern
town. Bandelier discredits the Montezuma myth, which he considers a Spanish-Mexican
importation. See Archæological Institute of America <cite>Papers</cite>, American

with the entire life of the Pueblos, he is in a sense a civil official as well. He is
chosen because of fitness, frequently on the nomination of his predecessor, and
his education in the mysteries and secrets of his people is exacting. The office is
for life, unless terminated by improper behavior, when the cacique may be deposed.
The candidate sometimes declines the office because of the severity of the duties,
which involve much fasting and abnegation.

The <i>estufa</i> is not always subterranean. It originated before the introduction
of Christian family life, in a common home for the male members of the pueblo.
It has become the council house of the tribe. Some pueblos contain more than
one; unless rites are in progress, it is a bare, rude room usually unornamented.

1540—see George P. Winship, <cite>Journey of Coronado</cite> (New York, 1904); and here
a great battle was fought between Spaniards and Acomans in 1599. The pueblo

<p>All the Indians of New Mexico not denominated Pueblos—not
professing the Christian religion—are ranked as
<i>wild tribes</i>, although these include some who have made
great advances in arts, manufactures and agriculture.
Those who are at all acquainted with the ancient history
of Mexico, will recollect that, according to the traditions
of the aborigines, all the principal tribes of Anahuac descended
from the North: and that those of Mexico, especially <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg068"></a>[p068]</span>
the Azteques, emigrated {283} from the north of California,
or northwest of New Mexico. Clavigero, the famous
historian heretofore alluded to,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> speaking of this emigration,
observes, that the <dfn>Azteques</dfn>, or Mexican Indians, who
were the last settlers in the country of Anahuac, lived until
about the year 1160 of the Christian era in Aztlan, a country
situated to the north of the Gulf of California; as is inferred
from the route of their peregrinations, and from the information
afterwards acquired by the Spaniards in their
expeditions through those countries. He then proceeds to
show by what incentives they were probably induced to
abandon their native land; adding that whatever may
have been the motive, no doubt can possibly exist as
to the journey's having actually been performed. He
says that they travelled in a southeastwardly direction
towards the Rio Gila, where they remained for some time—the
ruins of their edifices being still to be seen, upon
its banks. They then struck out for a point over two hundred
and fifty miles to the northwest of Chihuahua in about
29° of N. latitude, where they made another halt. This
place is known by the name of <dfn>Casas Grandes</dfn><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> (big houses),
on account of a large edifice which still stands on the spot,
and which, according to the general tradition of those regions,
was erected by the Mexican Indians, during their <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg069"></a>[p069]</span>
wanderings. The building is constructed after the plan
of those in New Mexico, with three stories, covered with
an <dfn>azotea</dfn> or terrace, and without door or entrance {284}
into the lower story. A hand ladder is also used as a means
of communication with the second story.</p>

<p>Even allowing that the traditions upon which Clavigero
founded his theoretical deductions are vague and uncertain,
there is sufficient evidence in the ruins that still exist to
show that those regions were once inhabited by a far more
enlightened people than are now to be found among the
aborigines. Of such character are the ruins of <i>Pueblo
Bonito</i>, in the direction of Navajó, on the borders of the
Cordilleras; the houses being generally built of slabs of
fine-grit sand-stone, a material utterly unknown in the
present architecture of the North.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Although some of
these structures are very massive and spacious, they are
generally cut up into small irregular rooms, many of which
yet remain entire, being still covered, with the <dfn>vigas</dfn> or
joists remaining nearly sound under the <i>azoteas</i> of earth;
and yet their age is such that there is no tradition which
gives any account of their origin. But there have been
no images or sculptured work of any kind found about them.
Besides these, many other ruins (though none so perfect)
are scattered over the plains and among the mountains.
What is very remarkable is, that a portion of them are
situated at a great distance from any water; so that the
inhabitants must have depended entirely upon rain, as
is the case with the Pueblo of Acoma at the present day.</p>

<p>The general appearance of Pueblo Bonito, {285} as
well as that of the existing buildings of Moqui in the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg070"></a>[p070]</span>
same mountainous regions, and other Pueblos of New
Mexico, resembles so closely the ruins of Casas Grandes,
that we naturally come to the conclusion that the founders
of each must have descended from the same common
stock. The present difference between their language and
that of the Indians of Mexico, when we take into consideration
the ages that have passed away since their separation,
hardly presents any reasonable objection to this hypothesis.</p>

<p>The principal wild tribes which inhabit or extend their
incursions or peregrinations upon the territory of New
Mexico, are the <i>Navajóes</i>, the <i>Apaches</i>, the <i>Yutas</i>, the
<i>Caiguas</i> or Kiawas, and the <i>Comanches</i>.<a name="FNanchor_38_38"
id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Of the latter
I will speak in another place. The two first are from one
and the same original stock, there being, even at the present
day, no very important difference in their language. The
Apaches are divided into numerous petty tribes, of one of
which an insignificant band, called Jicarillas, inhabiting
the mountains north of Taos, is an isolated and miserable
remnant.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The <dfn>Navajóes</dfn> are supposed to number about 10,000
souls, and though not the most numerous, they are certainly
the most important, at least in a historical point of view,
of all the northern tribes of Mexico. They reside in the
main range of Cordilleras, 150 to 200 miles west of Santa
Fé, on the waters of Rio Colorado of California, not far
from the region, according to historians, from whence the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg071"></a>[p071]</span>
{286} Azteques emigrated to Mexico; and there are many
reasons to suppose them direct descendants from the remnant,
which remained in the North, of this celebrated
nation of antiquity. Although they mostly live in rude
<dfn>jacales</dfn>, somewhat resembling the wigwams of the Pawnees,
yet, from time immemorial, they have excelled all others
in their original manufactures: and, as well as the Moquis,
they are still distinguished for some exquisite styles of cotton
textures, and display considerable ingenuity in embroidering
with feathers the skins of animals, according
to their primitive practice. They now also manufacture
a singular species of blanket, known as the <dfn>Sarape Navajó</dfn>,
which is of so close and dense a texture that it will frequently
hold water almost equal to gum-elastic cloth. It
is therefore highly prized for protection against the rains.
Some of the finer qualities are often sold among the Mexicans
as high as fifty or sixty dollars each.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the present predatory and somewhat
unsettled habits of the Navajóes, they cultivate all the
different grains and vegetables to be found in New Mexico.
They also possess extensive herds of horses, mules, cattle,
sheep and goats of their own raising, which are generally
celebrated as being much superior to those of the Mexicans;
owing, no doubt, to greater attention to the improvement
of their stocks.</p>

<p>Though Baron Humboldt<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> tells us that some missionaries
were established among this tribe {287} prior to the
general massacre of 1680, but few attempts to christianize
them have since been made. They now remain in a state
of primitive paganism—and not only independent of the
Mexicans, but their most formidable enemies.<a name="FNanchor_41_41"
id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg072"></a>[p072]</span></p>

<p> After the establishment of the national independence,
the government of New Mexico greatly embittered the
disposition of the neighboring savages, especially the
Navajoes, by repeated acts of cruelty and ill-faith well
calculated to provoke hostilities. On one occasion, a
party consisting of several chiefs and warriors of the Navajoes
assembled at the Pueblo of Cochiti,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> by invitation
of the government, to celebrate a treaty of peace; when
the New Mexicans, exasperated no doubt by the remembrance
of former outrages, fell upon them unawares and
put them all to death. It is also related, that about the
same period, three Indians from the northern mountains
having been brought as prisoners into Taos, they were
peremptorily demanded by the Jicarillas, who were their
bitterest enemies; when the Mexican authorities, dreading
the resentment of this tribe, quietly complied with the
barbarous request, suffering the prisoners to be butchered
in cold blood before their very eyes! No wonder, then,
that the New Mexicans are so generally warred upon by
their savage neighbors.</p>

<p>About fifteen years ago, the Navajoes were subjected
by the energy of Col. Vizcarra, who succeeded in keeping
them in submission for {288} some time; but since that
officer's departure from New Mexico, no man has been <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg073"></a>[p073]</span>
found of sufficient capacity to inspire this daring tribe either
with respect or fear; so that for the last ten years they have
ravaged the country with impunity, murdering and destroying
just as the humor happened to prompt them. When
the spring of the year approaches, terms of peace are generally
proposed to the government at Santa Fé, which the
latter never fails to accept. This amicable arrangement
enables the wily Indians to sow their crops at leisure, and
to dispose of the property stolen from the Mexicans during
their marauding incursions, to advantage; but the close of
their agricultural labors is generally followed by a renewal
of hostilities, and the game of rapine and destruction is
played over again.</p>

<p>Towards the close of 1835, a volunteer corps, which most
of the leading men in New Mexico joined, was raised for
the purpose of carrying war into the territory of the Navajoes.
The latter hearing of their approach, and anxious no doubt
to save them the trouble of so long a journey, mustered a
select band of their warriors, who went forth to intercept
the invaders in a mountain pass, where they lay concealed
in an ambuscade. The valiant corps, utterly unconscious
of the reception that awaited them, soon came jogging
along in scattered groups, indulging in every kind of
boisterous mirth; when the war-whoop, loud and shrill,
followed by several shots, threw them all into a state of
speechless consternation. {289} Some tumbled off their
horses with fright, others fired their muskets at random: a
terrific panic had seized everybody, and some minutes
elapsed before they could recover their senses sufficiently
to betake themselves to their heels. Two or three persons
were killed in this ridiculous engagement, the most conspicuous
of whom was a Capt. Hinófos, who commanded
the regular troops.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg074"></a>[p074]</span></p>

<p> A very curious but fully authentic anecdote may not be
inappropriately inserted here, in which this individual was
concerned. On one occasion, being about to start on a
belligerent expedition, he directed his orderly-sergeant to
fill a powder-flask from an unbroached keg of twenty-five
pounds. The sergeant, having bored a hole with a gimlet,
and finding that the powder issued too slowly, began to
look about for something to enlarge the aperture, when his
eyes haply fell upon an iron poker which lay in a corner of
the fire-place. To heat the poker and apply it to the hole
in the keg was the work of but a few moments; when an
explosion took place which blew the upper part of the
building into the street, tearing and shattering everything
else to atoms. Miraculous as their escape may appear, the
sergeant, as well as the captain who witnessed the whole
operation, remained more frightened than hurt, although
they were both very severely scorched and bruised. This
ingenious sergeant was afterwards Secretary of State to
Gov. Gonzalez, of revolutionary {290} memory,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and has
nearly ever since held a clerkship in some of the offices of
state, but is now captain in the regular army.</p>

<p>I come now to speak of the <dfn>Apaches</dfn>, the most extensive
and powerful, yet the most vagrant of all the savage nations
that inhabit the interior of Northern Mexico. They are
supposed to number some fifteen thousand souls, although
they are subdivided into various petty bands, and scattered
over an immense tract of country. Those that are found
east of the Rio del Norte are generally known as <dfn>Mezcaleros</dfn>,
on account of an article of food much in use among them,
called <dfn>mezcal</dfn>,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> but by far the greatest portion of the nation
is located in the west, and is mostly known by the sobriquet <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg075"></a>[p075]</span>
of <dfn>Coyoteros</dfn>, in consequence, it is said, of their eating the
<dfn>coyote</dfn> or prairie-wolf.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The Apaches are perhaps more
given to itinerant habits than any other tribe in Mexico.
They never construct houses, but live in the ordinary
wigwam, or tent of skins and blankets. They manufacture
nothing—cultivate nothing: they seldom resort to the
chase, as their country is destitute of game—but depend
almost entirely upon pillage for the support of their immense
population, some two or three thousand of which are warriors.</p>

<p>For their food, the Apaches rely chiefly upon the flesh of
the cattle and sheep they can steal from the Mexican ranchos
and haciendas. They are said, however, to be more fond of
{291} the meat of the mule than that of any other animal.
I have seen about encampments which they had recently
left, the remains of mules that had been slaughtered for
their consumption. Yet on one occasion I saw their whole
trail, for many miles, literally strewed with the carcasses of
these animals, which, it was evident, had not been killed for
this purpose. It is the practice of the Apache chiefs, as I
have understood, whenever a dispute arises betwixt their
warriors relative to the ownership of any particular animal,
to kill the brute at once, though it be the most valuable of
the drove; and so check all further cavil. It was to be
inferred from the number of dead mules they left behind
them, that the most harmonious relations could not have
existed between the members of the tribe, at least during
this period of their journeyings. Like most of the savage
tribes of North America, the Apaches are passionately fond
of spirituous liquors, and may frequently be seen, in times <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg076"></a>[p076]</span>
of peace, lounging about the Mexican villages, in a state of
helpless inebriety.</p>

<p>The range of this marauding tribe extends over some
portions of California, most of Sonora, the frontiers of
Durango, and at certain seasons it even reaches Coahuila:
Chihuahua, however, has been the mournful theatre of their
most constant depredations. Every nook and corner of this
once flourishing state has been subjected to their inroads.
Such is the imbecility of the local governments, that the
savages, in order to dispose of {292} their stolen property
without even a shadow of molestation, frequently enter into
partial treaties of peace with one department, while they continue
to wage a war of extermination against the neighboring
states. This arrangement supplies them with an ever-ready
market, for the disposal of their booty and the purchase of
munitions wherewith to prosecute their work of destruction.
In 1840, I witnessed the departure from Santa Fé of a large
trading party freighted with engines of war and a great
quantity of whiskey, intended for the Apaches in exchange
for mules and other articles of plunder which they had stolen
from the people of the south. This traffic was not only
tolerated but openly encouraged by the civil authorities, as
the highest public functionaries were interested in its success—the
governor himself not excepted.</p>

<p>The Apaches, now and then, propose a truce to the government
of Chihuahua, which is generally accepted very
nearly upon their own terms. It has on some occasions been
included that the marauders should have a <em>bonâ fide</em> right to
all their stolen property. A <dfn>venta</dfn> or quit-claim brand, has
actually been marked by the government upon large numbers
of mules and horses which the Indians had robbed from
the citizens. It is hardly necessary to add that these truces
have rarely been observed by the wily savages longer than <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg077"></a>[p077]</span>
the time necessary for the disposal of their plunder. As soon
as more mules were needed for service or for traffic—more
cattle for beef—more {293} scalps for the war-dance—they
would invariably return to their deeds of ravage and murder.</p>

<p>The depredations of the Apaches have been of such long
duration, that, beyond the immediate purlieus of the towns,
the whole country from New Mexico to the borders of
Durango is almost entirely depopulated. The haciendas
and ranchos have been mostly abandoned, and the people
chiefly confined to towns and cities. To such a pitch has
the temerity of those savages reached, that small bands of
three or four warriors have been known to make their appearance
within a mile of the city of Chihuahua in open day,
killing the laborers and driving off whole herds of mules and
horses without the slightest opposition. Occasionally a
detachment of troops is sent in pursuit of the marauders, but
for no other purpose, it would seem, than to illustrate the
imbecility of the former, as they are always sure to make a
precipitate retreat, generally without even obtaining a
glimpse of the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> And yet the columns of a little
weekly sheet published in Chihuahua always teem with
flaming accounts of prodigious feats of valor performed by
the 'army of operations' against <i>los bárbaros</i>: showing how
"the enemy was pursued with all possible vigor"—how the
soldiers "displayed the greatest {294} bravery, and the most
unrestrainable desire to overhaul the dastards," and by what
extraordinary combinations of adverse circumstances they
were "compelled to relinquish the pursuit." Indeed, it
would be difficult to find a braver race of people than the
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg078"></a>[p078]</span>
<dfn>Chihuahueños</dfn><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a
href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
contrive to make themselves appear upon
paper. When intelligence was received in Chihuahua of the
famous skirmish with the French, at Vera Cruz, in which
Santa Anna acquired the glory of losing a leg,<a name="FNanchor_49_49"
id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
the event was
celebrated with uproarious demonstrations of joy; and the
next number of the <cite>Noticioso</cite><a name="FNanchor_50_50"
id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
contained a valiant fanfaronade,
proclaiming to the world the astounding fact, that one
Mexican was worth four French soldiers in battle: winding
up with a "<cite>Cancion Patriótica</cite>," of which the following exquisite
verse was the <i>refrain</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
"<i>Chihuahuenses, la Patria gloriosa<br />
Otro timbre á su lustre ha añadido</i>;<br />
<i>Pues la</i>, ıuʌıɔʇɐ lɐ פɐlıɐ ıupoɯɐqlǝ<br />
Al valor mexicano <i>ha cedido</i>."
</div>

<p class="continue">Literally translated:</p>

<div class="poetry">
Chihuahuenses! our glorious country<br />
Another ray has added to her lustre;<br />
For the <em>invincible, indomitable Gallia</em><br />
Has succumbed to Mexican valor.
</div>

<p>By the inverted letters of "<em>invicta, la Galia indomable</em>,"
in the third line, the poet gives {295} the world to understand
that the kingdom of the Gauls had at length been whirled
topsy-turvy, by the glorious achievements of <em>el valor Mexicano</em>!</p>

<p>From what has been said of the ravages of the Apaches,
one would be apt to believe them an exceedingly brave people;
but the Mexicans themselves call them cowards when compared
with the Comanches; and we are wont to look upon
the latter as perfect specimens of poltroonery when brought <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg079"></a>[p079]</span>
in conflict with the Shawnees, Delawares, and the rest of
our border tribes.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>There was once a celebrated chief called Juan José at
the head of this tribe, whose extreme cunning and audacity
caused his name to be dreaded throughout the country.
What contributed more than anything else to render him a
dangerous enemy, was the fact of his having received a
liberal education at Chihuahua, which enabled him, when he
afterwards rejoined his tribe, to outwit his pursuers, and,
by robbing the mails, to acquire timely information of every
expedition that was set on foot against him. The following
account of the massacre in which he fell may not be
altogether uninteresting to the reader.</p>

<p>The government of Sonora, desirous to make some
efforts to check the depredations of the Apaches, issued a
proclamation, giving a sort of <i>carte blanche</i> patent of 'marque
and reprisal,' and declaring all the booty that might be
taken from the savages to be the rightful property of the
captors. Accordingly, in the {296} spring of 1837, a party
of some 20 men composed chiefly of foreigners, spurred
on by the love of gain, and never doubting but the Indians,
after so many years of successful robberies, must be possessed
of a vast amount of property, set out with an American
as their commander, who had long resided in the country.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
In a few days they reached a <i>ranchería</i> of about
fifty warriors with their families, among whom was the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg080"></a>[p080]</span>
famous Juan José himself, and three other principal chiefs.
On seeing the Americans advance, the former at once
gave them to understand, that, if they had come to fight,
they were ready to accommodate them; but on being assured
by the leader, that they were merely bent on a trading
expedition, a friendly interview was immediately established
between the parties. The American captain having
determined to put these obnoxious chiefs to death under
any circumstances, soon caused a little field-piece which
had been concealed from the Indians to be loaded with
chain and canister shot, and to be held in readiness for use.
The warriors were then invited to the camp to receive a
present of flour, which was placed within range of the cannon.
While they were occupied in dividing the contents
of the bag, they were fired upon and a considerable number
of their party killed on the spot! The remainder were
then attacked with small arms, and about twenty slain,
including Juan José and the other chiefs. Those who
escaped became afterwards their own avengers in a {297}
manner which proved terribly disastrous to another party
of Americans, who happened at the time to be trapping
on Rio Gila not far distant. The enraged savages resolved
to take summary vengeance upon these unfortunate trappers;
and falling upon them, massacred them every one!<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
They were in all, including several Mexicans, about fifteen
in number.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg081"></a>[p081]</span></p>

<p> The projector of this scheme had probably been under
the impression that treachery was justifiable against a
treacherous enemy. He also believed, no doubt, that the
act would be highly commended by the Mexicans who
had suffered so much from the depredations of these notorious
chiefs. But in this he was sadly mistaken; for the
affair was received with general reprehension, although
the Mexicans had been guilty of similar deeds themselves,
as the following brief episode will sufficiently show.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1839, a few Apache prisoners, among
whom was the wife of a distinguished {298} chief, were
confined in the calabozo of Paso del Norte. The bereaved
chief, hearing of their captivity, collected a band of about
sixty warriors, and, boldly entering the town, demanded
the release of his consort and friends. The commandant
of the place wishing to gain time, desired them to return
the next morning, when their request would be granted.
During the night the forces of the country were concentrated;
notwithstanding, when the Apaches reappeared,
the troops did not show their faces, but remained concealed,
while the Mexican commandant strove to beguile the
Indians into the prison, under pretence of delivering to
them their friends. The unsuspecting chief and twenty
others were entrapped in this manner, and treacherously
dispatched in cold blood: not, however, without some loss
to the Mexicans, who had four or five of their men killed
in the fracas. Among these was the commandant himself,
who had no sooner given the word, "<dfn>¡Maten á los
carajos!</dfn>" (kill the scoundrels!) than the chief retorted, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg082"></a>[p082]</span>
"<dfn>¡Entónces morirás tu primero, carajo!</dfn>" (then you shall
die first, carajo!) and immediately stabbed him to the
heart!</p>

<p>But as New Mexico is more remote from the usual haunts
of the Apaches, and, in fact, as her scanty ranchos present
a much less fruitful field for their operations than the
abundant haciendas of the South, the depredations of this
tribe have extended but little upon that province. The
only serious incursion that has come within my knowledge,
was some ten {299} years ago. A band of Apache warriors
boldly approached the town of Socorro<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> on the southern
border, when a battle ensued between them and the Mexican
force, composed of a company of regular troops and
all the militia of the place. The Mexicans were soon completely
routed and chased into the very streets, suffering
a loss of thirty-three killed and several wounded. The
savages bore away their slain, yet their loss was supposed
to be but six or seven. I happened to be in the vicinity
of the catastrophe the following day, when the utmost
consternation prevailed among the inhabitants, who were
in hourly expectation of another descent from the savages.</p>

<p>Many schemes have been devised from time to time,
particularly by the people of Chihuahua, to check the
ravages of the Indians, but generally without success.
Among these the notorious <dfn>Proyecto de Guerra</dfn>, adopted
in 1837, stands most conspicuous. By this famous 'war-project'
a scale of rewards was established, to be paid out
of a fund raised for that purpose. A hundred dollars
reward were offered for the scalp of a full grown man,
fifty for that of a squaw, and twenty-five for that of every
papoose! To the credit of the republic, however, this
barbarous <i>proyecto</i> was in operation but a few weeks, and <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg083"></a>[p083]</span>
never received the sanction of the general government;
although it was strongly advocated by some of the most
intelligent citizens of Chihuahua. Yet, pending its existence,
it was rigidly complied with. I saw myself, on one
{300} occasion, a detachment of horsemen approach the
Palacio in Chihuahua, preceded by their commanding
officer, who bore a fresh scalp upon the tip of his lance,
which he waved high in the air in exultation of his exploit!
The next number of our little newspaper contained the
official report of the affair. The soldiers were pursuing
a band of Apaches, when they discovered a squaw who
had lagged far behind in her endeavors to bear away her
infant babe. They dispatched the mother without commiseration
and took her scalp, which was the one so 'gallantly'
displayed as already mentioned! The officer concluded
his report by adding, that the child had died not
long after it was made prisoner.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Yutas</dfn> (or <dfn>Eutaws</dfn>, as they are generally styled by
Americans) are one of the most extensive nations of the
West, being scattered from the north of New Mexico to the
borders of Snake river and Rio Colorado, and numbering
at least ten thousand souls. The habits of the tribe are
altogether itinerant. A band of about a thousand spend
their winters mostly in the mountain valleys northward
of Taos, and the summer season generally in the prairie
plains to the east, hunting buffalo. The vernacular language
of the Yutas is said to be distantly allied to that of
the Navajoes, but it has appeared to me much more guttural,
having a deep sepulchral sound resembling ventriloquism.
Although these Indians are nominally at peace
with the New Mexican government, they do not hesitate
to lay {301} the hunters and traders who happen to fall in
with their scouring parties under severe contributions;
and on some occasions they have been known to proceed <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg084"></a>[p084]</span>
even to personal violence. A prominent Mexican officer<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
was scourged not long ago by a party of Yutas, and yet
the government has never dared to resent the outrage.
Their hostilities, however, have not been confined to Mexican
traders, as will be perceived by the sequel.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1837, a small party of but five or six
Shawnees fell in with a large band of Yutas near the eastern
borders of the Rocky Mountains, south of Arkansas river.
At first they were received with every demonstration of
friendship; but the Yutas, emboldened no doubt by the
small number of their visitors, very soon concluded to
relieve them of whatever surplus property they might be
possessed of. The Shawnees, however, much to the astonishment
of the marauders, instead of quietly surrendering
their goods and chattels, offered to defend them; upon
which a skirmish ensued that actually cost the Yutas several
of their men, including a favorite chief; while the Shawnees
made their escape unhurt toward their eastern homes.</p>

<p>A few days after this event, and while the Yutas were
still bewailing the loss of their people, I happened to pass
near their <dfn>rancherías</dfn> (temporary village) with a small
caravan which mustered about thirty-five men. We {302}
had hardly pitched our camp, when they began to flock
about us—men, squaws, and papooses—in great numbers;
but the warriors were sullen and reserved, only now and
then muttering a curse upon the Americans on account of
the treatment they had just received from the Shawnees,
whom they considered as half-castes, and our allies. All
of a sudden, a young warrior seized a splendid steed which
belonged to our party, and, leaping upon his back, galloped <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg085"></a>[p085]</span>
off at full speed. Being fully convinced that, by acquiescing
in this outrage, we should only encourage them to commit
others, we resolved at once to make a peremptory demand
for the stolen horse of their principal chief. Our request
being treated with contumely, we sent in a warlike declaration,
and forthwith commenced making preparations
for descending upon the <i>rancherías</i>. The war-whoop
resounded immediately in every direction; and as the
Yutas bear a very high character for bravery and skill,
the readiness with which they seemed to accept our challenge
began to alarm our party considerably. We had
defied them to mortal combat merely by way of bravado,
without the least expectation that they would put themselves
to so much inconvenience on our account. It was
too late, however, to back out of the scrape.</p>

<p>No sooner had the alarm been given than the <i>rancherías</i>
of the Indians were converted into a martial encampment;
and while the mounted warriors were exhibiting their
preliminary {303} feats of horsemanship, the squaws and
papooses flew like scattered partridges to the rocks and
clefts of a contiguous precipice. One-third of our party
being Mexicans, the first step of the Indians was to proclaim
a general <i>indulto</i> to them, in hopes of reducing our
force, scanty as it was already. "My Mexican friends,"
exclaimed in good Spanish, a young warrior who daringly
rode up within a few rods of us, "we don't wish to hurt
<em>you</em>; so leave those Americans, for we intend to kill every
one of <em>them</em>." The Mexicans of our party to whom this
language was addressed, being rancheros of some mettle,
only answered, "<em>Al diablo</em>! we have not forgotten how
you treat us when you catch us alone: now that we are with
Americans who will defend their rights, expect ample <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg086"></a>[p086]</span>
retaliation for past insults." In truth, these rancheros
seemed the most anxious to begin the fight,—a remarkable
instance of the effects of confidence in companions.</p>

<p>A crisis seemed now fast approaching: two swivels we
had with us were levelled and primed, and the matches
lighted. Every man was at his post, with his rifle ready
for execution, each anxious to do his best, whatever might
be the result; when the Indians, seeing us determined to
embrace the chances of war, began to open negotiations.
An aged squaw, said to be the mother of the principal
chief, rode up and exclaimed, "My sons! the Americans
and Yutas have been friends, and our old men wish to
continue so: it is only a {304} few impetuous and strong-headed
youths who want to fight." The stolen horse
having been restored soon after this harangue, peace was
joyfully proclaimed throughout both encampments, and
the <i>capitanes</i> exchanged ratifications by a social smoke.</p>

<p>The little tribe of Jicarillas also harbored an enmity
for the Americans, which, in 1834, broke out into a hostile
<i>rencontre</i>. They had stolen some animals of a gallant
young backwoodsman from Missouri, who, with a few
comrades, pursued the marauders into the mountains and
regained his property; and a fracas ensuing, an Indian or
two were killed. A few days afterward all their warriors
visited Santa Fé in a body, and demanded of the authorities
there, the delivery of the American offenders to their vengeance.
Though the former showed quite a disposition
to gratify the savages as far as practicable, they had not
helpless creatures to deal with, as in the case of the Indian
prisoners already related. The foreigners, seeing their
protection devolved upon themselves, prepared for defence,
when the savages were fain to depart in peace.</p>

<p>I do not propose to detain the reader with an account
of my journeyings between Mexico and the United States,
during the seven years subsequent to my first arrival at
Santa Fé. I will here merely remark, that I crossed the
plains to the United States in the falls of 1833 and 1836,
and returned to Santa Fé with goods each succeeding
spring. It was only in 1838, however, that I eventually
closed up my affairs in Northern Mexico, and prepared
to take my leave of the country, as I then supposed, forever.
But in this I was mistaken, as will appear in the sequel.</p>

<p>The most usual season for the return of the {306} caravans
to the United States is the autumn, and not one has elapsed
since the commencement of the trade which has not witnessed
some departure from Santa Fé with that destination.
They have also crossed occasionally in the spring, but
without any regularity or frequency, and generally in very
small parties. Even the 'fall companies,' in fact, are
small when compared with the outward-bound caravans;
for besides the numbers who remain permanently in the
country, many of those who trade southward return to
the United States <i>via</i> Matamoros or some other Southern
port. The return parties of autumn are therefore comparatively
small, varying in number from fifty to a hundred <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg088"></a>[p088]</span>
men. They leave Santa Fé some four or five weeks after
their arrival—generally about the first of September.
In these companies there are rarely over thirty or forty
wagons; for a large portion of those taken out by the annual
caravans are disposed of in the country.</p>

<p>Some of the traders who go out in the spring, return the
ensuing fall, because they have the good fortune to sell
off their stock promptly and to advantage: others are compelled
to return in the fall to save their credit; nay, to preserve
their homes, which, especially in the earlier periods,
have sometimes been mortgaged to secure the payment of
the merchandise they carried out with them. In such
cases, their goods were not unfrequently sold at great
sacrifice, to avoid the penalties which the breaking of their
engagements at home {307} would involve. New adventurers,
too, are apt to become discouraged with an
unanticipated dullness of times, and not unfrequently
sell off at wholesale for the best price they can get, though
often at a serious loss. But those who are regularly engaged
in this trade usually calculate upon employing a
season—perhaps a year, in closing an enterprise—in
selling off their goods and making their returns.</p>

<p>The wagons of the return caravans are generally but
lightly laden: one to two thousand pounds constitute the
regular return cargo for a single wagon; for not only are
the teams unable to haul heavy loads, on account of the
decay of pasturage at this season, but the approaching
winter compels the traders to travel in greater haste; so
that this trip is usually made in about forty days. The
amount of freight, too, from that direction is comparatively
small. The remittances, as has already been mentioned,
are chiefly in specie, or gold and silver bullion. The gold
is mostly <i>dust</i>, from the Placer or gold mine near Santa Fé:<a
name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg089"></a>[p089]</span> the silver
bullion is all from the mines of the South—chiefly
from those of Chihuahua. To these returns may
be added a considerable number of mules and asses—some
buffalo rugs, furs, and wool,—which last barely
pays a return freight for the wagons that would otherwise
be empty. Coarse Mexican blankets, which may be
obtained in exchange for merchandise, have been sold in
small quantities to advantage on our border.</p>

<p>{308} On the 4th of April, 1838, we departed from
Santa Fé. Our little party was found to consist of twenty-three
Americans, with twelve Mexican servants. We had
seven wagons, one dearborn, and two small field-pieces,
besides a large assortment of small-arms. The principal
proprietors carried between them about $150,000 in specie
and bullion, being for the most part the proceeds of the
previous year's adventure.</p>

<p>We moved on at a brisk and joyous pace until we reached
Ocaté creek, a tributary of the Colorado,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> a distance of a
hundred and thirty miles from Santa Fé, where we encountered
a very sudden bereavement in the death of Mr.
Langham, one of our most respected proprietors. This
gentleman was known to be in weak health, but no fears
were entertained for his safety. We were all actively
engaged in assisting the more heavily laden wagons over
the miry stream, when he was seized with a fit of apoplexy
and expired instantly. As we had not the means of giving
the deceased a decent burial, we were compelled to consign
him to the earth in a shroud of blankets. A grave was
accordingly dug on an elevated spot near the north bank
of the creek, and on the morning of the 13th, ere the sun
had risen in the east, the mortal remains of this most worthy
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg090"></a>[p090]</span> man and valued friend were deposited in their last abode,—without
a tomb-stone to consecrate the spot, or an
epitaph to commemorate his virtues. The deceased was
from St. Louis, {309} though he had passed the last eleven
years of his life in Santa Fé, during the whole of which
period he had seen neither his home nor his relatives.</p>

<p>The melancholy rites being concluded, we resumed our
line of march. We now continued for several days without
the occurrence of any important accident or adventure.
On the 19th we encamped in the Cimarron valley, about
twelve miles below the Willow Bar. The very sight of
this desolate region, frequented as it is by the most savage
tribes of Indians, was sufficient to strike dismay into the
hearts of our party; but as we had not as yet encountered
any of them, we felt comparatively at ease. Our mules
and horses were 'staked' as usual around the wagons, and
every man, except the watch, betook himself to his blanket,
in anticipation of a good night's rest. The hour of midnight
had passed away, and nothing had been heard except
the tramping of the men on guard, and the peculiar grating
of the mules' teeth, nibbling the short grass of the valley.
Ere long, however, one of our sentinels got a glimpse of
some object moving stealthily along, and as he was straining
his eyes to ascertain what sort of apparition it could be, a
loud Indian yell suddenly revealed the mystery. This
was quickly followed by a discharge of fire-arms, and the
shrill note of the 'Pawnee whistle,' which at once made
known the character of our visitors. As usual, the utmost
confusion prevailed in our camp: some, who had been
snatched {310} from the land of dreams, ran their heads
against the wagons—others called out for their guns while
they had them in their hands. During the height of the
bustle and uproar, a Mexican servant was observed leaning
with his back against a wagon, and his fusil elevated at an <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg091"></a>[p091]</span>
angle of forty-five degrees, cocking and pulling the trigger
without ceasing, and exclaiming at every snap, "<dfn>Carajo,
no sirve!</dfn>"—Curse it, it's good for nothing.</p>

<p>The firing still continued—the yells grew fiercer and
more frequent; and everything betokened the approach of
a terrible conflict. Meanwhile a number of persons were
engaged in securing the mules and horses which were
staked around the encampment; and in a few minutes
they were all shut up in the <dfn>corral</dfn>—a hundred head or
more in a pen formed by seven wagons. The enemy
failing in their principal object—to frighten off our stock,
they soon began to retreat; and in a few minutes nothing
more was to be heard of them. All that we could discover
the next morning was, that none of our party had sustained
any injury, and that we had not lost a single animal.</p>

<p>The Pawnees have been among the most formidable
and treacherous enemies of the Santa Fé traders. But
the former have also suffered a little in turn from the caravans.
In 1832, a company of traders were approached
by a single Pawnee chief, who commenced a parley with
them, when he was shot down by a Pueblo Indian of New
Mexico who happened {311} to be with the caravan. Though
this cruel act met with the decided reprobation of the traders
generally, yet they were of course held responsible for it
by the Indians.</p>

<p>On our passage this time across the 'prairie ocean'
which lay before us, we ran no risk of getting bewildered
or lost, for there was now a plain wagon trail across the
entire stretch of our route, from the Cimarron to Arkansas
river.</p>

<p>This track, which has since remained permanent, was
made in the year 1834. Owing to continuous rains during
the passage of the caravan of that year, a plain trail was
then cut in the softened turf, on the most direct route across <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg092"></a>[p092]</span>
this arid desert, leaving the Arkansas about twenty miles
above the 'Caches.' This has ever since been the regular
route of the caravans; and thus a recurrence of those distressing
sufferings from thirst, so frequently experienced
by early travellers in that inhospitable region, has been
prevented.</p>

<p>We forded the Arkansas without difficulty, and pursued
our journey to the Missouri border with comparative ease;
being only now and then disturbed at night by the hideous
howling of wolves, a pack of which had constituted themselves
into a kind of 'guard of honor,' and followed in our
wake for several hundred miles—in fact to the very border
of the settlements. They were at first attracted no doubt
by the remains of buffalo which were killed by us upon the
high plains, and {312} afterwards enticed on by an occasional
fagged animal, which we were compelled to leave behind,
as well as by the bones and scraps of food, which they
picked up about our camps. Not a few of them paid the
penalty of their lives for their temerity.</p>

<p>Had we not fortunately been supplied with a sufficiency
of meat and other provisions, we might have suffered of
hunger before reaching the settlements; for we saw no
buffalo after crossing the Arkansas river. It is true that,
owing to their disrelish for the long dry grass of the eastern
prairies, the buffalo are rarely found so far east in autumn
as during the spring; yet I never saw them so scarce in this
region before. In fact, at all seasons, they are usually
very abundant as far east as our point of leaving the Arkansas
river.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the settlements, I had an opportunity of
experiencing a delusion which had been the frequent subject
of remark by travellers on the Prairies before. Accustomed
as we had been for some months to our little
mules, and the equally small-sized Mexican ponies, our <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg093"></a>[p093]</span>
sight became so adjusted to their proportions, that when
we came to look upon the commonest hackney of our
frontier horses, it appeared to be almost a monster. I
have frequently heard exclamations of this kind from the
new arrivals:—"How the Missourians have improved
their breed of horses!"—"What a huge gelding!"—"Did
you ever see such an animal!" This delusion is frequently
availed of by the frontiersmen {313} to put off their meanest
horses to these deluded travellers for the most enormous
prices.</p>

<p>On the 11th of May we arrived at Independence, after
a propitious journey of only thirty-eight days.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> We
found the town in a thriving condition, although it had
come very near being laid waste a few years before by the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg094"></a>[p094]</span>
Mormons, who had originally selected this section of the
country for the site of their New Jerusalem. In this they
certainly displayed far more taste and good sense than
they are generally supposed to be endowed {314} with: for
the rich and beautiful uplands in the vicinity of Independence
might well be denominated the 'garden spot' of the
Far West. Their principal motive for preferring the
border country, however, was no doubt a desire to be in
the immediate vicinity of the Indians, as the reclamation
of the 'Lost tribes of Israel' was a part of their pretended
mission.</p>

<p>Prior to 1833, the Mormons, who were then flocking in
great swarms to this favored region, had made considerable
purchases of lots and tracts of land both in the town of
Independence and in the adjacent country. A general
depot, profanely styled the 'Lord's Store,' was established,
from which the faithful were supplied with merchandise
at moderate prices; while those who possessed any surplus
of property were expected to deposit it in the same, for the
benefit of the mass. The Mormons were at first kindly
received by the good people of the country, who looked
upon them as a set of harmless fanatics, very susceptible
of being moulded into good and honest citizens. This
confidence, however, was not destined to remain long in
the ascendant, for they soon began to find that the corn
in their cribs was sinking like snow before the sun-rays,
and that their hogs and their cattle were by some mysterious
agency rapidly disappearing. The new-comers also drew
upon themselves much animadversion in consequence of
the immorality of their lives, and in particular their disregard
for the sacred rites of marriage.</p>

<p>{315} Still they continued to spread and multiply, not
by conversion but by immigration, to an alarming extent;
and in proportion as they grew strong in numbers, they <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg095"></a>[p095]</span>
also became more exacting and bold in their pretensions.
In a little paper printed at Independence under their immediate
auspices,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> everything was said that could provoke
hostility between the 'saints' and their 'worldly' neighbors,
until at last they became so emboldened by impunity, as
openly to boast of their determination to be the sole proprietors
of the 'Land of Zion;' a revelation to that effect
having been made to their prophet.</p>

<p>The people now began to perceive, that, at the rate the
intruders were increasing, they would soon be able to command
a majority of the country, and consequently the
entire control of affairs would fall into their hands. It
was evident, then, that one of the two parties would in the
course of time have to abandon the country; for the old
settlers could not think of bringing up their families in the
midst of such a corrupt state of society as the Mormons
were establishing. Still the nuisance was endured very
patiently, and without any attempt at retaliation, until the
'saints' actually threatened to eject their opponents by
main force. This last stroke of impudence at once roused
the latent spirit of the honest backwoodsmen, some of
whom were of the pioneer settlers of Missouri, and had
become familiar with danger in their terrific wars with the
savages. They were therefore by no {316} means appropriate
subjects for yielding what they believed to be their
rights. Meetings were held for the purpose of devising
means of redress, which only tended to increase the insolence
of the Mormons. Finally a mob was collected
which proceeded at once to raze the obnoxious printing
establishment to the ground, and to destroy all the materials
they could lay hands upon. One or two of the Mormon
leaders who fell into the hands of the people, were treated <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg096"></a>[p096]</span>
to a clean suit of 'tar and feathers,' and otherwise severely
punished.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The 'Prophet Joseph,' however, was not then
in the neighborhood. Having observed the storm-clouds
gathering apace in the frontier horizon, he very wisely
remained in Ohio, whence he issued his flaming mandates.</p>

<p>These occurrences took place in the month of October,
1833, and I reached Independence from Santa Fé while
the excitement was raging at its highest. The Mormons
had rallied some ten miles west of the town, where their
strongest settlements were located. A hostile encounter
was hourly expected: nay, a skirmish actually took place
shortly after, in which a respectable lawyer of Independence,
who had been an active agent against the Mormons,
was killed. In short, the whole country was in a state of
dreadful fermentation.</p>

<p>Early on the morning after the skirmish just referred
to, a report reached Independence that the Mormons were
marching in a {317} body towards the town, with the intention
of sacking and burning it. I had often heard the cry
of "Indians!" announcing the approach of hostile savages,
but I do not remember ever to have witnessed so much
consternation as prevailed at Independence on this memorable
occasion. The note of alarm was sounded far and
near, and armed men, eager for the fray, were rushing in
from every quarter. Officers were summarily selected
without deference to rank or station: the 'spirit-stirring
drum' and the 'ear-piercing fife' made the air resound with
music, and a little army of as brave and resolute a set of
fellows as ever trod a field of battle, was, in a very short
time, paraded through the streets. After a few preliminary
exercises, they started for a certain point on the road where
they intended to await the approach of the Mormons. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg097"></a>[p097]</span>
The latter very soon made their appearance, but surprised
at meeting with so formidable a reception, they never even
attempted to pull a trigger, but at once surrendered at
discretion. They were immediately disarmed, and subsequently
released upon condition of their leaving the country
without delay.</p>

<p>It was very soon after this affair that the much talked
of phenomenon of the meteoric shower (on the night of
November 12th) occurred. This extraordinary visitation
did not fail to produce its effects upon the superstitious
minds of a few ignorant people, who began to wonder
whether, after all, the Mormons might not be in the right;
and whether this was not a sign sent from heaven as a
remonstrance for the injustice they had been guilty of
towards that chosen sect.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Sometime afterward, a terrible
misfortune occurred which was in no way calculated to
allay the superstitious fears of the ignorant. As some
eight or ten citizens were returning with the ferry-boat
which had crossed the last Mormons over the Missouri
river, into Clay county, the district selected for their new
home, the craft filled with water and sunk in the middle
of the current; by which accident three or four men were
drowned!<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> It was owing perhaps to the craziness of the
boat, yet some persons suspected the Mormons of having
scuttled it by secretly boring auger-holes in the bottom
just before they had left it.</p>

<p>After sojourning a few months in Clay county, to the
serious annoyance of the inhabitants (though, in fact, they <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg098"></a>[p098]</span>
had been kindly received at first), the <i>persecuted</i> 'Latter
day Saints' were again compelled to shift their quarters
further off. They now sought to establish themselves in
the new country of Caldwell, and founded their town of
Far West, where they lingered in comparative peace for
a few years.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> As the county began to fill up with settlers
however, quarrels repeatedly {319} broke out, until at last,
in 1838, they found themselves again at open war with their
neighbors. They appear to have set the laws of the state
at defiance, and to have acted so turbulently throughout,
that Governor Boggs deemed it necessary to order out a
large force of state militia to subject them: which was
easily accomplished without bloodshed. From that time
the Mormons have harbored a mortal enmity towards the
Governor: and the attempt which was afterwards made
to assassinate him at Independence, is generally believed
to have been instigated, if not absolutely perpetrated, by
that deluded sect.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Being once more forced to emigrate, they passed into
Illinois, where they founded the famous 'City of Nauvoo.'
It would seem that their reception from the people of this
state was even more strongly marked with kindness and
indulgence than it had been elsewhere, being generally
looked upon as the victims of persecution on account of <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg099"></a>[p099]</span>
their religious belief; yet it appears that the good people
of Illinois have since become about as tired of them as were
any of their former neighbors.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> It seems very clear then,
that fanatical delusion is not the only sin which stamps
the conduct of these people with so much obliquity, or they
would certainly have found permanent friends somewhere;
whereas it is well known that a general aversion has prevailed
against them wherever they have sojourned.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter, it may be {320} proper
to remark, that the Mormons have invariably refused to
sell any of the property they had acquired in Missouri, but
have on the contrary expressed a firm determination to
reconquer their lost purchases.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Of these, a large lot,
situated on an elevated point at Independence, known as
the 'Temple Lot,' upon which the 'Temple of Zion' was
to have been raised,—has lately been 'profaned,' by
cultivation, having been converted into a corn-field!</p>

has been known to antiquarians since the first discovery of the region. The earliest
detailed description was written after the visit of Father Kuehne (Kino) in 1694.
American explorers noted it during the passage of 1846; Bartlett's description of
1854 was the most faithful. For recent accounts, see Cosmos Mindeleff, in U. S.
Bureau of Ethnology <cite>Reports</cite>, 1891-92, pp. 295-361; 1893-94, pp. 321-349. In
1889 congress appropriated funds for its preservation and repair, and in 1892 set
it apart as a public reservation. Modern archæologists discredit any connection
of its builders with Mexican Aztecs. It is a work of Pueblo Indians, probably of
the ancestors of the modern Pima—see our volume xviii, p. 200, note 96. This ruin
should not be confused with one of a like name in Northern Mexico, for which see
volume xviii of our series, p. 155, note 88.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

from Acoma, answers his description as built of sandstone. There is a small ruin

is the former, on the well-known trace between Acoma and Zuñi, and of remarkably
good workmanship in stone.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

 The Jicarrilla (Xicarrilla) are of <i>Athapascan</i> stock, but from the similarity
of their language are classed as Apache, although they are not known to have had
any tribal connection with them. Their alliance was more frequently with the
Ute, with whom they intermarried, and whose customs they assimilated.
They were a predatory race, and from their vantage ground on the upper waters
of the Rio Grande, Pecos, and Canadian, caused much annoyance. They are
now located on a reservation in Rio Arriba County, and number about seven hundred
and fifty.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

began depredations and cattle lifting, and frequent campaigns against them were
undertaken. In 1744 a mission was attempted among them, which was abandoned
after six years' futile efforts. Serious difficulties, however, did not recur until the
beginning of the nineteenth century. The period of Gregg's sojourn in New
Mexico was that of greatest hostility. For over twenty-five years the United
States government had much difficulty with the Navaho. There are yet over
twenty thousand of these tribesmen on the different reservations, chiefly in Arizona.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

of 1680 and 1696, and part of the mutineers were, about 1699, removed to the
pueblo of Laguna. There are now less than two hundred and fifty inhabitants

their cowardice. Since the running of the boundary line after the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo
(1848) up to 1886, one outbreak after another characterized our
relations with the Apache. For fifteen years (1871-86) General Crook watched
the Apache, and after each raid forced them back upon their reservations.

foreigners—restrained either by fear or respect. Small parties of the latter were
permitted to pass the highways of the wilderness unmolested, while large caravans
of Mexicans suffered frequent attacks. This apparent partiality produced unfounded
jealousies, and the Americans were openly accused of holding secret
treaties with the enemy, and even of supplying them with arms and ammunition.
Although an occasional foreigner engaged in this clandestine and culpable traffic,
yet the natives themselves embarked in it beyond comparison more extensively,
as has been noted in another place. This unjust impression against Americans
was partially effaced as well by the catastrophes mentioned in the text, as by the
defeat and robbery (in which, however, no American lives were lost), of a small
party of our people, about the same period, in <cite>La Jornada del Muerto</cite>, on their way

"extermination order," issued in October, 1838. The attempt to assassinate
him at the close of his term of office, at his home in Independence (1841), was
popularly ascribed to a Mormon fanatic, who was, however, acquitted in the courts.
In 1846 Governor Boggs led an overland party to California, where he assisted in
the American occupation. Removed to Napa Valley in 1852, he died there nine
years later. His wife was a granddaughter of Daniel Boone.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p>An unconquerable propensity to return to prairie life
inclined me to embark in a fresh enterprise. The blockade <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg100"></a>[p100]</span>
of the Mexican ports by the French also offered strong
inducements for undertaking such an expedition in the
spring of 1839; for as Chihuahua is supplied principally
through the sea-ports, it was now evident that the place
must be suffering from great scarcity of goods. Being
anxious to reach the market before the ports of the Gulf
were reopened, we deemed it expedient to abandon the
regular route from {10} Missouri for one wholly untried,
from the borders of Arkansas, where the pasturage springs
up nearly a month earlier. It is true, that such an attempt
to convey heavily laden wagons through an unexplored
region was attended with considerable risk; but as I was
familiar with the general character of the plains contiguous
to the north, I felt little or no apprehension of serious difficulties,
except from what might be occasioned by regions of
sandy soil. I have often been asked since, why we did not
steer directly for Chihuahua, as our trade was chiefly
destined for that place, instead of taking the circuitous
route <i>via</i> Santa Fé. I answer, that we dreaded a journey
across the southern prairies on account of the reputed aridity
of the country in that direction, and I had no great desire to
venture directly into a southern port in the present state
of uncertainty as to the conditions of entry.</p>

<p>Suitable arrangements having been made, and a choice
stock of about $25,000 worth of goods shipped to Van Buren<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
on the Arkansas river, we started on the evening of the 21st
of April, but made very little progress for the first eight days.
While we were yet but ten or fifteen miles from Van Buren, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg101"></a>[p101]</span>
an incident occurred which was attended with very melancholy
results. A young man named Hays, who had driven
a wagon for me for several months through the interior of
Mexico, and thence to the United States in 1838, having
heard that this expedition was projected, {11} was desirous
of engaging again in the same employ. I was equally
desirous to secure his services, as he was well-tried, and had
proved himself an excellent fellow on those perilous journeys.
But soon after our outset, and without any apparent reason,
he expressed an inclination to abandon the trip. I earnestly
strove to dissuade him from his purpose, and supposed I
had succeeded. What was my surprise, then, upon my
return after a few hours' absence in advance of the company,
to learn that he had secretly absconded! I was now led to
reflect upon some of his eccentricities, and bethought me of
several evident indications of slight mental derangement.
We were, however, but a few miles from the settlements of
the whites, and in the midst of the civilized Cherokees, where
there was little or no danger of his suffering; therefore, there
seemed but little occasion for serious uneasiness on his
account. As it was believed he had shaped his course back
to Van Buren, I immediately wrote to our friends there,
to have search made for him. However, nothing could be
found of him till the next day, when his hat and coat were
discovered upon the bank of the Arkansas, near Van Buren,
which were the last traces ever had of the unfortunate
Hays! Whether intentionally or accidentally, he was evidently
drowned.</p>

<p>On the 28th of April we crossed the Arkansas river a few
miles above the mouth of the Canadian fork.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> We had only
proceeded {12} a short distance beyond, when a Cherokee
shop-keeper came up to us with an attachment for debt <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg102"></a>[p102]</span>
against a free mulatto whom we had engaged as teamster.
The poor fellow had no alternative but to return with the
importunate creditor, who committed him at once to the
care of 'Judge Lynch' for trial. We ascertained afterwards
that he had been sentenced to 'take the benefit of the bankrupt
law' after the manner of the Cherokees of that neighborhood.
This is done by stripping and tying the victim
to a tree; when each creditor, with a good cowhide or
hickory switch in his hand, scores the amount of the bill due
upon his bare back. One stripe for every dollar due is the
usual process of 'whitewashing;' and as the application of
the lash is accompanied by all sorts of quaint remarks, the
exhibition affords no small merriment to those present, with
the exception, no doubt, of the delinquent himself. After
the ordeal is over, the creditors declare themselves perfectly
satisfied: nor could they, as is said, ever be persuaded thereafter
to receive one red cent of the amount due, even if it
were offered to them. As the poor mulatto was also in our
debt, and was perhaps apprehensive that we might exact
payment in the same currency, he never showed himself
again.</p>

<p>On the 2d of May we crossed the North Fork of the
Canadian about a mile from its confluence with the main
stream. A little westward of this there is a small village of
{13} Creek Indians, and a shop or two kept by American
traders.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> An Indian who had quarrelled with his wife,
came out and proposed to join us, and, to our great surprise,
carried his proposal into execution. The next morning his
repentant consort came into our camp, and set up a most
dismal weeping and howling after her truant husband, who,
notwithstanding, was neither to be caught by tears nor <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg103"></a>[p103]</span>
softened by entreaties, but persisted in his determination to
see foreign countries. His name was Echú-eleh-hadjó (or
<dfn>Crazy-deer-foot</dfn>), but, for brevity's sake, we always called
him <dfn>Chuly</dfn>. He was industrious, and possessed many clever
qualities, though somewhat disposed to commit excesses
whenever he could procure liquor, which fortunately did
not occur until our arrival at Santa Fé. He proved to be a
good and willing hand on the way, but as he spoke no
English, our communication with him was somewhat
troublesome. I may as well add here, that, while in Santa
Fé, he took another freak and joined a volunteer corps,
chiefly of Americans, organized under one James Kirker to
fight the Navajó and Apache Indians; the government of
Chihuahua having guarantied to them all the spoils they
should take.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> With these our Creek found a few of his 'red
brethren'—Shawnees and Delawares, who had wandered
thus far from the frontier of Missouri. After this little
army was disbanded, Chuly returned home, as I have been
informed, with a small {14} party who crossed the plains
directly from Chihuahua.</p>

<p>We had never considered ourselves as perfectly <i>en chemin</i>
till after crossing the Arkansas river; and as our little party
experienced no further change, I may now be permitted to
introduce them collectively to the reader. It consisted of
thirty-four men, including my brother John Gregg and
myself. These men had all been hired by us except three,
two of whom were Eastern-bred boys—a tailor and a silversmith—good-natured,
clever little fellows, who had thought
themselves at the 'jumping-off place' when they reached <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg104"></a>[p104]</span>
Van Buren, but now seemed nothing loth to extend their
peregrinations a thousand miles or so further, in the hope
of 'doing' the 'Spaniards,' as the Mexicans are generally
styled in the West, out of a little surplus of specie. The other
was a German peddler, who somewhat resembled the
Dutchman's horse, "put him as you vant, and he ish alvays
tere;" for he did nothing during the whole journey but
descant on the value of a chest of trumperies which he carried,
and with which he calculated, as he expressed it, to
"py a plenty of te Shpanish tollar." The trip across the
Prairies cost these men absolutely nothing, inasmuch as we
furnished them with all the necessaries for the journey, in
consideration of the additional strength they brought to our
company.</p>

<p>It is seldom that such a variety of ingredients are found
mixed up in so small a compass. {15} Here were the representatives
of seven distinct nations, each speaking his own
native language, which produced at times a very respectable
jumble of discordant sounds. There was one Frenchman
whose volubility of tongue and curious gesticulations, contrasted
very strangely with the frigidity of two phlegmatic
wanderers from Germany; while the calm eccentricity of
two Polish exiles, the stoical look of two sons of the desert
(the Creek already spoken of, and a Chickasaw), and the
pantomimic gestures of sundry loquacious Mexicans, contributed
in no small degree to heighten the effects of the
picture. The Americans were mostly backwoodsmen, who
could handle the rifle far better than the whip, but who
nevertheless officiated as wagoners.</p>

<p>We had fourteen road-wagons, half drawn by mules, the
others by oxen (eight of each to the team); besides a carriage
and a Jersey wagon. Then we had two swivels mounted
upon one pair of wheels; but one of them was attached to
a movable truckle, so that, upon stopping, it could be transferred <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg105"></a>[p105]</span>
to the other side of the wagons. One of these was a
long brass piece made to order, with a calibre of but an inch
and a quarter, yet of sufficient metal to throw a leaden ball
to the distance of a mile with surprising accuracy. The
other was of iron, and a little larger. Besides these, our
party was well supplied with small arms. The Americans
mostly had their rifles and a musket in addition, which {16}
they carried in their wagons, always well charged with ball
and buckshot. Then my brother and myself were each
provided with one of Colt's repeating rifles, and a pair of
pistols of the same, so that we could, if necessary, carry
thirty-six ready-loaded shots apiece; which alone constituted
a capacity of defence rarely matched even on the Prairies.</p>

<p>Previous to our departure we had received a promise from
the war department of an escort of U.S. Dragoons, as far as
the borders of the Mexican territory; but, upon sending an
express to Gen. Arbuckle at Fort Gibson to that effect,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> we
were informed that in consequence of some fresh troubles
among the Cherokees, it was doubtful whether the force
could be spared in time. This was certainly no very agreeable
news, inasmuch as the escort would have been very
serviceable in assisting to search out a track over the unexplored
wilderness we had to pass. It was too late, however,
to recede; and so we resolved at all hazards to pursue our
journey.
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg106"></a>[p106]</span></p>

<p> We had advanced beyond the furthest settlements of the
Creeks and Seminoles, and pitched our camp on a bright
balmy evening, in the border of a delightful prairie, when
some of the young men, attracted by the prospect of game,
shouldered their rifles and wended their steps through the
dense forest which lay contiguous to our encampment.
Among those that went forth, there was one of the 'down-easters'
already mentioned, who was much more familiar
with the interior of {17} a city than of a wilderness forest.
As the shades of evening were beginning to descend, and all
the hunters had returned except him, several muskets and
even our little field-pieces were fired, but without effect.
The night passed away, and the morning dawned upon the
encampment, and still he was absent. The firing was then
renewed; but soon after he was seen approaching, very
sullen and dejected. He came with a tale of perilous
adventures and 'hair-breadth 'scapes' upon his lips, which
somewhat abated the storm of ridicule by which he was at
first assailed. It seemed that he had heard our firing on
the previous evening, but believed it to proceed from a contrary
direction—a very common mistake with persons who
have become bewildered and lost. Thus deceived and
stimulated by the fear of Indians (from a party of whom he
supposed the firing to proceed), he continued his pathless
wanderings till dark, when, to render his situation still more
critical, he was attacked by a 'painter'—<dfn>anglicè</dfn>, panther—which
he actually succeeded in beating off with the breech
of his gun, and then betook himself to the topmost extremity
of a tree, where, in order to avoid a similar intrusion, he
passed the remainder of the night. From a peculiar odor
with which the shattered gun was still redolent, however, it
was strongly suspected that the 'terrific painter' was not
many degrees removed, in affinity, from a——polecat.</p>

<p>We had just reached the extreme edge of {18} the far <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg107"></a>[p107]</span>
famed 'Cross Timbers,'<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> when we were gratified by the
arrival of forty dragoons, under the command of Lieut.
Bowman, who had orders to accompany us to the supposed
boundary of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_75_75"
id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> On the same evening we
had the pleasure of encamping together at a place known as
Camp Holmes, a wild romantic spot in latitude <span class="fraction">35° 5′</span>, and
but a mile north of the Canadian river. Just at hand there
was a beautiful spring, where, in 1835, Colonel Mason with a
force of U. S. troops, had a 'big talk' and still bigger 'smoke'
with a party of Comanche and Witchita Indians.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Upon
the same site Col. Chouteau had also caused to be erected
not long after, a little stockade fort, where a considerable
trade was subsequently carried on with the Comanches and
other tribes of the southwestern prairies. The place had
now been abandoned, however, since the preceding winter.</p>

<p>From the Arkansas river to Chouteau's Fort, our route
presented an unbroken succession of grassy plains and fertile
glades, intersected here and there with woody belts and
numerous rivulets, most of which, however, are generally
dry except during the rainy season. As far as Camp Holmes,
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg108"></a>[p108]</span> we had a passable wagon road, which was opened upon the
occasion of the Indian treaty before alluded to, and was
afterwards kept open by the Indian traders. Yet, notwithstanding
the road, this stretch gave us more trouble—presented
more rugged passes, miry ravines and steep {19}
ascents—than all the rest of our journey put together.</p>

<p>We had not been long at the Fort, before we received a
visit from a party of Comanches, who having heard of our
approach came to greet us a welcome, on the supposition
that it was their friend Chouteau returning to the fort with
fresh supplies of merchandise. Great was their grief when
we informed them that their favorite trader had died at Fort
Gibson, the previous winter.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> On visiting their wigwams
and inquiring for their <i>capitan</i>,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> we were introduced to a
corpulent, squint-eyed old fellow, who certainly had nothing
in his personal appearance indicative of rank or dignity.
This was Tábba-quena (or the Big Eagle), a name familiar
to all the Comanche traders. As we had frequently heard
that he spoke Spanish fluently, we at once prepared ourselves
for a social chit-chat; but, on accosting him in that tongue,
and inquiring whether he could talk Spanish, he merely
replied '<dfn>Poquito</dfn>,' putting at the same time his forefinger to
his ear, to signify that he merely understood a little—which
proved true to a degree, for our communication was chiefly <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg109"></a>[p109]</span>
by signs. We were now about to launch upon an unknown
region—our route lay henceforth across that unexplored
wilderness, of which I have so frequently spoken, without
either pilot or trail to guide us for nearly 500 miles. We had
to depend entirely upon {20} our knowledge of the geographical
position of the country for which we were steering, and
the indications of a compass and sextant. This was emphatically
a pioneer trip; such a one also as had, perhaps,
never before been undertaken—to convey heavily laden
wagons through a country almost wholly untrod by civilized
man, and of which <em>we</em>, at least, knew nothing. We were
therefore extremely anxious to acquire any information our
visitors might be able to give us; but Tábba-quena being
by no means experienced in wagon tactics, could only make
us understand, by gestures, mixed with a little wretched
Spanish, that the route up the Canadian presented no
obstacles according to <em>his</em> mode of travelling. He appeared,
however, very well acquainted with the whole Mexican
frontier, from Santa Fé to Chihuahua, and even to the Gulf,
as well as with all the Prairies. During the consultation he
seemed occasionally to ask the opinions of other chiefs who
had huddled around him. Finally, we handed him a sheet
of paper and a pencil, signifying at the same time a desire
that he would draw us a map of the Prairies. This he very
promptly executed; and although the draft was somewhat
rough, it bore, much to our astonishment, quite a map-like
appearance, with a far more accurate delineation of all the
principal rivers of the plains—the road from Missouri to
Santa Fé, and the different Mexican settlements, than is to
be found in many of the engraved maps of those regions.</p>

<p>{21}Tabba-quena's party consisted of about sixty persons,
including several squaws and papooses, with a few Kiawa
chiefs and warriors, who, although of a tribe so entirely distinct,
are frequently found domiciled among the Comanches.
As we were about to break up the camp they all started for <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg110"></a>[p110]</span>
Fort Gibson, for the purpose, as they informed us, of paying
a visit to the 'Capitan Grande'—a Spanish phrase used by
many prairie tribes, and applied, in their confused notions
of rank and power, not only to the President of the United
States himself, but to the seat of the federal government.
These they are again apt to confound with Fort Gibson and
the commanding officer of that station.</p>

<p>On the 18th of May, we set out from Chouteau's fort.
From this forward our wagons were marched in two lines
and regularly 'formed' at every camp, so as to constitute a
fortification and a <i>corral</i> for the stock. This is different
from the 'forming' of the large caravans. The two front
wagons are driven up, side by side, with their 'tails' a little
inclined outward. About half of the rest are drawn up in
the same manner, but each stopped with the fore-wheel a
little back of the hind-wheel of the next ahead. The remainder
are similarly brought up, but inclined inward behind,
so as nearly to close again at the rear of the pen;
leaving a gap through which to introduce the stock. Thus
the <i>corral</i> remains of an ovate form. After the drivers
become expert the whole is performed in a very short time.</p>

<p>{22}On the following day we were again joined by old
Tabba-quena, and another Comanche chief, with five or
six warriors, and as many squaws, including Tab's wife and
infant son. As we were jogging along in the afternoon, I
held quite a long conversation in our semi-mute language
with the squinting old chief. He gave me to understand,
as well as he could, that his comrades<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> had proceeded on
their journey to see the Capitan Grande, but that he had concluded
to return home for better horses. He boasted in no
measured terms of his friendship for the Americans, and <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg111"></a>[p111]</span>
promised to exert his influence to prevent turbulent and
unruly spirits of his nation from molesting us. But he
could not disguise his fears in regard to the Pawnees and
Osages, who, he said, would be sure to run off with our
stock while we were asleep at night. When I informed him
that we kept a strict night-watch, he said, "<dfn>Está bueno</dfn>"
(that's good), and allowed that our chances for safety were
not so bad after all.</p>

<p>These friendly Indians encamped with us that night, and
on the following morning the old chief informed us that some
of his party had a few "mulas para <dfn>swap</dfn>" (mules to trade;
for having learned the word <i>swap</i> of some American traders,
he very ingeniously tacked it at the tail of his little stock of
Spanish). A barter of five mules was immediately concluded
{23} upon, much to our advantage, as our teams were
rather in a weak condition. Old Tab and his party then
left us to join his band, which, he said, was located on the
Faux Ouachittâ river, and we never saw aught of them
more.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>After leaving the Fort we generally kept on the ridge
between the Canadian and the North Fork, crossing sometimes
the tributary brooks of the one and sometimes those
of the others. Having travelled in this manner for about
eighty miles, we entered one of the most charming prairie
vales that I have ever beheld, and which in the plenitude
of our enthusiasm, we named 'Spring Valley,' on account of
the numerous spring-fed rills and gurgling rivulets that
greeted the sight in every direction;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> in whose limpid pools
swarms of trout and perch were carelessly playing. Much
of the country, indeed, over which we had passed was somewhat
of a similar character—yet nowhere quite so beautiful.
I must premise, however, that westward of this, it <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg112"></a>[p112]</span>
is only the valleys immediately bordering the streams that
are at all fit for cultivation: the high plains are too dry and
sandy. But here the soil was dark and mellow, and the
rich vegetation with which it was clothed plainly indicated
its fertility. 'Spring Valley' gently inclines towards the
North Fork, which was at the distance of about five miles
from our present route. It was somewhere along the border
of this enchanting vale that a little picket fort was erected in
{24} 1822, by an unfortunate trader named McKnight, who
was afterwards betrayed and murdered by the faithless
Comanches.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The landscape is beautifully variegated with
stripes and fringes of timber: while the little herds of buffalo
that were scattered about in fantastic groups imparted a
degree of life and picturesqueness to the scene, which it was
truly delightful to contemplate.</p>

<p>It was three days previous that we had first met with these
'prairie cattle.' I have often heard backwoodsmen speak
of the 'buck ague,' but commend me to the 'buffalo fever'
of the Prairies for novelty and amusement. Very few of
our party had ever seen a buffalo before in its wild state;
therefore at the first sight of these noble animals the excitement
surpassed anything I had ever witnessed before. Some
of our dragoons, in their eagerness for sport, had managed
to frighten away a small herd that were quietly feeding at
some distance, before our 'still hunters,' who had crawled
towards them, had been able to get within rifle-shot of them.
No sooner were the movements of our mounted men perceived,
than the whole extent of country, as far as the eye
could reach, became perfectly animate with living objects,
fleeing and scampering in every direction. From the surrounding
valleys sprang up numerous herds of these animals
which had hitherto been unobserved, many of which, in their
indiscriminate flight, passed so near the wagons, that the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg113"></a>[p113]</span>
drivers, carried away by the contagious excitement of {25}
the moment, would leave the teams and keep up a running
fire after them. I had the good fortune to witness the
exploits of one of our Northern greenhorns, who, mounted
upon a sluggish mule, and without any kind of weapon,
amused himself by chasing every buffalo that came scudding
along, as if he expected to capture him by laying hold of his
tail. Plying spur and whip, he would gallop after one
division till he was left far behind: and then turn to another
and another, with the same earnestness of purpose, until
they had all passed out of sight. He finally came back disheartened
and sullen, with his head hanging down like one
conscious of having done something supremely ridiculous;
but still cursing his lazy mule, which, he said, might have
caught the buffalo, if it had had a mind to.</p>

<p>The next day the buffalo being still more numerous, the
chase was renewed with greater zest. In the midst of the
general hurly-burly which ensued, three persons on foot were
perceived afar off, chasing one herd of buffalo and then
another, until they completely disappeared. These were
two of our cooks, the one armed with a pistol, the other with
a musket, accompanied by Chuly (the Creek), who was
happily provided with a rifle. We travelled several miles
without hearing or seeing anything of them. At last, when
we had almost given them up for lost, Frank, the French
cook, came trudging in, and his rueful countenance was no
bad index of the {26} doleful tale he had to relate. Although
he had been chasing and shooting all day, he had, as he
expressed it, "no killet one," till eventually he happened
to stumble upon a wounded calf, which he boldly attacked;
but as ill luck would have it, the youngster took it into his
head to give him battle. "Foutre de varment! he butt me
down," exclaimed the exasperated Frenchman,—"Sacré!
me plentee scart; but me kill him for all." Chuly and the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg114"></a>[p114]</span>
other cook came in soon after, in equally dejected spirits;
for, in addition to his ill luck in hunting, the latter had been
lost. The Indian had perhaps killed buffalo with his rifle,
but he was in no humor to be communicative in his language
of signs; so nothing was ever known of his adventures.
One thing seemed pretty certain, that they were all cured of
the 'buffalo fever.'</p>

<p>On the night after the first buffalo scamper, we encamped
upon a woodless ravine, and were obliged to resort to 'buffalo
chips' (dry ordure) for fuel. It is amusing to witness the
bustle which generally takes place in collecting this offal.
In dry weather it is an excellent substitute for wood, than
which it even makes a hotter fire; but when moistened by
rain, the smouldering pile will smoke for hours before it condescends
to burn, if it does at all. The buffalo meat which
the hunter roasts or broils upon this fire, he accounts more
savory than the steaks dressed by the most delicate cooks in
civilized life.</p>

the west, so that this military post fell within its border. Later (1830), the boundary
was again replaced at the original limits, whereupon Fort Gibson fell into Cherokee
territory. Several unavailing efforts were made (1834-38) to have the garrison
removed to Fort Smith; and after numerous protests by the Cherokee against its
maintenance within their borders, Fort Gibson was finally abandoned in 1857.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p>As it now appeared that we had been forced at least two
points north of the course we had originally intended to
steer, by the northern bearing of the Canadian, we made an
effort to cross a ridge of timber to the south, which, after
considerable labor, proved successful. Here we found a <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg115"></a>[p115]</span>
multitude of gravelly, bright-flowing streams, with rich bottoms,
lined all along with stately white oak, black-walnut,
mulberry, and other similar growths, that yielded us excellent
materials for wagon repairs, of which the route from Missouri,
after passing Council Grove, is absolutely in want.</p>

<p>{28} Although we found the buffalo extremely scarce westward
of Spring Valley, yet there was no lack of game; for
every nook and glade swarmed with deer and wild turkeys,
partridges and grouse. We had also occasion to become
acquainted with another species of prairie-tenant whose
visits generally produced impressions that were anything
but agreeable. I allude to a small black insect generally
known to prairie travellers as the 'buffalo-gnat.' It not
only attacks the face and hands, but even contrives to insinuate
itself under the clothing, upon the breast and arms, and
other covered parts. Here it fastens itself and luxuriates,
until completely satisfied. Its bite is so poisonous as to give
the face, neck, and hands, or any other part of the person
upon which its affectionate caresses have been bestowed,
the appearance of a pustulated varioloid. The buffalo-gnat
is in fact a much more annoying insect than the mosquito,
and also much more frequently met with on the prairie
streams.</p>

<p>We now continued our line of march between the Canadian
and the timbered ridge with very little difficulty. Having
stopped to 'noon' in a bordering valley, we were quite surprised
by the appearance of an Indian with no other protection
than his squaw. From what we could gather by their
signs, they had been the victims of a 'love scrape.' The
fellow, whom I found to be a Kiawa, had, according to his
own account, stolen the wife of another, and then fled to the
thickets, {29} where he purposed to lead a lonely life, in hopes
of escaping the vengeance of his incensed predecessor.
From this, it would appear that affairs of gallantry are not <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg116"></a>[p116]</span>
evils exclusively confined to civilization. Plausible, however,
as the Indian's story seemed to be, we had strong suspicions
that others of his band were not far off; and that
he, with his 'better half,' had only been skulking about in
hopes of exercising their 'acquisitiveness' at our expense;
when, on finding themselves discovered, they deemed it the
best policy fearlessly to approach us. This singular visit
afforded a specimen of that confidence with which civilization
inspires even the most untutored savages. They remained
with us, in the utmost nonchalance, till the following
morning.</p>

<p>Shortly after the arrival of the visitors, we were terribly
alarmed at a sudden prairie conflagration. The old grass
of the valley in which we were encamped had not been
burned off, and one of our cooks having unwittingly kindled
a fire in the midst of it, it spread at once with wonderful
rapidity; and a brisk wind springing up at the time, the
flames were carried over the valley, in spite of every effort
we could make to check them. Fortunately for us, the fire
had broken out to the leeward of our wagons, and therefore
occasioned us no damage; but the accident itself was a
forcible illustration of the danger that might be incurred by
pitching a camp in the midst of dry grass, and the advantages
{30} that might be taken by hostile savages in such a
locality.</p>

<p>After the fire had raged with great violence for a few hours,
a cloud suddenly obscured the horizon, which was almost immediately
followed by a refreshing shower of rain: a phenomenon
often witnessed upon the Prairies after an extensive
conflagration; and affording a practical exemplification of
Professor Espy's celebrated theory of artificial showers.<a
name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg117"></a>[p117]</span></p>

<p> We now continued our journey without further trouble,
except that of being still forced out of our proper latitude
by the northern bearing of the Canadian. On the 30th of
May, however, we succeeded in 'doubling' the spur of the
Great North Bend.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Upon ascending the dividing ridge
again, which at this point was entirely destitute of timber, a
'prairie expanse' once more greeted our view. This and the
following day, our route lay through a region that abounded
in gypsum, from the finest quality down to ordinary plaster.
On the night of the 31st we encamped on a tributary of the
North Fork, which we called Gypsum creek, in consequence
of its being surrounded with vast quantities of that substance.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Being compelled to keep a reckoning of our latitude, by
which our travel was partly governed, and the sun being now
too high at noon for the use of the artificial horizon, we had
to be guided entirely by observations of the meridian altitude
of the moon, planets, or {31} fixed stars. At Gypsum creek
our latitude was <span class="fraction">36° 10′</span>—being the utmost northing we
had made. As we were now about thirty miles north of the
parallel of Santa Fé, we had to steer, henceforth, a few
degrees south of west in order to bring up on our direct
course.</p>

<p>The following night we encamped in a region covered
with sandy hillocks, where there was not a drop of water
to be found: in fact, an immense sand-plain was now
opening before us, somewhat variegated in appearance, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg118"></a>[p118]</span>
being entirely barren of vegetation in some places, while
others were completely covered with an extraordinarily
diminutive growth which has been called <dfn>shin-oak</dfn>, and a
curious plum-bush of equally dwarfish stature. These
singular-looking plants (undistinguishable at a distance
from the grass of the prairies) were heavily laden with acorns
and plums, which, when ripe, are of considerable size
although the trunks of either were seldom thicker than oat-straws,
and frequently not a foot high. We also met with the
same in many other places on the Prairies.</p>

<p>Still the most indispensable requisite, water, was nowhere
to be found, and symptoms of alarm were beginning to spread
far and wide among us. When we had last seen the Canadian
and the North Fork, they appeared to separate in their
course almost at right angles, therefore it was impossible
to tell at what distance we were from either. At last {32} my
brother and myself, who had been scouring the plains during
the morning without success, finally perceived a deep hollow
leading in the direction of the Canadian, where we found a
fine pool of water, and our wagons 'made port' again before
mid-day; thus quieting all alarm.</p>

<p>Although we had encountered but very few buffalo since
we left Spring Valley, they now began to make their appearance
again, though not in very large droves; together with
the deer and the fleet antelope, which latter struck me as
being much more tame in this wild section of the Prairies
than I had seen it elsewhere. The graceful and majestic
mustang would also now and then sweep across the naked
country, or come curvetting and capering in the vicinity
of our little caravan, just as the humor prompted him. But
what attracted our attention most were the little dog settlements,
or, as they are more technically called, 'dog towns,'
so often alluded to by prairie travellers. As we were passing
through their 'streets,' multitudes of the diminutive inhabitants <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg119"></a>[p119]</span>
were to be seen among the numerous little hillocks
which marked their dwellings, where they frisked about, or
sat perched at their doors, yelping defiance, to our great
amusement—heedless of the danger that often awaited
them from the rifles of our party; for they had perhaps never
seen such deadly weapons before.</p>

<p>On the 5th of June, we found ourselves once more travelling
on a firm rolling prairie, {33} about the region, as we
supposed,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> of the boundary between the United States and
Mexico; when Lieut. Bowman, in pursuance of his instructions,
began to talk seriously of returning. While the
wagons were stopped at noon, a small party of us, including
a few dragoons, advanced some miles ahead to take a survey
of the route. We had just ascended the highest point of a
ridge to get a prospect of the country beyond, when we
descried a herd of buffalo in motion and two or three horsemen
in hot pursuit. "Mexican Ciboleros!" we all exclaimed
at once; for we supposed we might now be within the range
of the buffalo hunters of New Mexico. Clapping spurs to
our horses, we set off towards them at full speed. As we
might have expected, our precipitate approach frightened
them away and we soon lost sight of them altogether. On
reaching the spot where they had last been seen, we found a
horse and two mules saddled, all tied to the carcass of a
slain buffalo which was partly skinned. We made diligent
search in some copses of small growth, and among the
adjacent ravines, but could discover no further traces of the
fugitives. The Indian rigging of the animals, however,
satisfied us that they were not Mexicans.</p>

<p>We were just about giving up the pursuit, when a solitary
Indian horseman was espied upon a ridge about a mile from <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg120"></a>[p120]</span>
us. My {34} brother and myself set out towards him, but
on seeing us approach, he began to manifest some fear, and
therefore my brother advanced alone. As soon as he was
near enough he cried out "<i>Amigo!</i>" to which the Indian
replied "<i>Comantz!</i>" and giving himself a thump upon the
breast, he made a graceful circuit, and came up at full speed,
presenting his hand in token of friendship. Nothing, however,
could induce him to return to his animals with us,
where the rest of our party had remained. He evidently
feared treachery and foul play. Therefore we retraced our
steps to the wagons, leaving the Indian's property just as
we had found it, which, we subsequently discovered, was
taken away after our departure.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the same day, five more Indians
(including a squaw), made their appearance, and having
been induced by friendly tokens to approach us, they spent
the night at our encampment. The next morning, we
expressed a desire, by signs, to be conducted to the nearest
point on our route where good pasturage and water might
be found. A sprightly young chief, armed only with his
bow and arrows, at once undertook the task, while his comrades
still travelled along in our company. We had not progressed
far before we found ourselves in the very midst of
another large 'dog-town.'</p>

<p>The task of describing the social and domestic habits of
these eccentric little brutes, has been so graphically and
amusingly executed {35} by the racy and popular pen of G.
Wilkins Kendall, that any attempt by me would be idle;
and I feel that the most agreeable service I can do my readers
is to borrow a paragraph from his alluring "Narrative,"
describing a scene presented by one of these prairie commonwealths.<a
name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg121"></a>[p121]</span></p>

<p> "In their habits they are clannish, social, and extremely
convivial, never living alone like other animals, but, on the
contrary, always found in villages or large settlements.
They are a wild, frolicsome, madcap set of fellows when
undisturbed, uneasy and ever on the move, and appear to
take especial delight in chattering away the time, and visiting
from hole to hole to gossip and talk over each other's affairs—at
least so their actions would indicate.... On
several occasions I crept close to their villages, without being
observed, to watch their movements. Directly in the centre
of one of them I particularly noticed a very large dog, sitting
in front of the door or entrance to his burrow, and by his
own actions and those of his neighbors it really seemed as
though he was the president, mayor, or chief—at all events,
he was the 'big dog' of the place. For at least an hour I
secretly watched the operations in this community. During
that time the large dog I have mentioned received at least a
dozen visits from his fellow-dogs, which would stop and chat
with him a few moments, and then run off to their domiciles.
All this while he never left his post for a moment, and I
thought I could discover a gravity in his deportment {36} not
discernible in those by which he was surrounded. Far is it
from me to say that the visits he received were upon business,
or had anything to do with the local government of the
village; but it certainly appeared so. If any animal has a
system of laws regulating the body politic, it is certainly the
prairie dog."</p>

<p>As we sat on our horses, looking at these 'village transactions,'
our Comanche guide drew an arrow for the purpose
of cutting short the career of a little citizen that sat
yelping most doggedly in the mouth of his hole, forty or
fifty paces distant. The animal was almost entirely concealed
behind the hillock which encompassed the entrance
of his apartment, so that the dart could not reach it in a <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg122"></a>[p122]</span>
direct line; but the Indian had resort to a manœuvre which
caused the arrow to descend with a curve, and in an instant
it quivered in the body of the poor little quadruped. The
slayer only smiled at his feat, while we were perfectly astounded.
There is nothing strange in the rifleman's being
able to hit his mark with his fine-sighted barrel; but the
accuracy with which these savages learn to shoot their
feathered missiles, with such random aim, is almost incomprehensible.
I had at the same time drawn one of Colt's
repeating pistols, with a view of paying a similar compliment
to another dog; when, finding that it excited the curiosity
of the chief, I fired a few shots in quick succession, as an
explanation of its virtues. He seemed to {37} comprehend
the secret instantly, and, drawing his bow once more, he
discharged a number of arrows with the same rapidity, as a
palpable intimation that he could shoot as fast with his
instrument as we could with our patent fire-arms. This
was not merely a vain show: there was more of reality than
of romance in his demonstration.</p>

<p>Shortly after this we reached a fresh brook, a tributary of
the North Fork, which wound its silent course in the midst
of a picturesque valley, surrounded by romantic hills and
craggy knobs. Here we pitched our camp: when three of
our visitors left us for the purpose of going to bring all the
'capitanes' of their tribe, who were said to be encamped
at no great distance from us.</p>

<p>Our encampment, which we designated as 'Camp Comanche,'
was only five or six miles from the North Fork,
while, to the southward, the main Canadian was but a little
more distant.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<div class="caption">Camp Comanche</div>
<div class="IlloRtn"><a
href="#ILLUSTRATIONS_TO_VOLUME_XX">Illustrations List</a></div>
</div>

<p>After waiting anxiously for the arrival of the Comanche
chiefs, until our patience was well nigh exhausted, I ascended
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg125"></a>[p125]</span> a high knoll just behind our camp, in company with the
younger of the two chiefs who had remained with us, to see
if anything could be discovered. By and by, the Comanche
pointed anxiously towards the northwest, where he espied a
party of his people, though at such a great distance, that it
was some time before I could discern them. With what
acuteness of vision are these savages endowed! Accustomed
{38} to the open plains, and like the eagle to look out
for their prey at immense distances, their optical perception
is scarcely excelled by that of the king of birds.</p>

<p>The party, having approached still nearer, assembled
upon an eminence as if for the purpose of reconnoitring;
but our chief upon the knoll hoisting his blanket, which
seemed to say, 'come ahead,' they advanced slowly and
deliberately—very unlike the customary mode of approach
among all the prairie tribes.</p>

<p>The party consisted of about sixty warriors, at the head
of whom rode an Indian of small stature and agreeable
countenance, verging on the age of fifty. He wore the usual
Comanche dress, but instead of moccasins, he had on a pair
of long white cotton hose, while upon his bare head waved
a tall red plume,—a mark of distinction which proclaimed
him at once the <dfn>capitan mayor</dfn>, or principal chief. We
addressed them in Spanish, inquiring if they had brought
an interpreter, when a lank-jawed, grum-looking savage
announced his readiness to officiate in that capacity. "<dfn>Sabes
hablar en Español, amigo?</dfn>" (can you talk Spanish, friend?)
I inquired. "<dfn>Si</dfn>" (yes), he gruffly replied. "Where are
your people?" "Encamped just above on yonder creek."
"How many of you are there?" "Oh, a great many—nearly
all the Comanche nation; for we are <i>en junta</i> to go
and fight the Pawnees." "Well, can you tell us how far it
is to Santa Fé?"—But the surly savage cut short my inquiries
by observing—{39} "<dfn>Ahí platícarémos despues</dfn>"—"We
will talk about that hereafter." <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg126"></a>[p126]</span></p>

<p>We then showed them a spot a few rods from us, where
they might encamp so as not to intermix their animals with
ours; after which all the <i>capitanes</i> were invited to our camp
to hold a 'big talk.' In a very short time we had ten chiefs
seated in a circle within our tent, when the pipe, the Indian
token of peace, was produced: but, doubting perhaps the
sincerity of our professions, they at first refused to smoke.
The interpreter, however, remarked as an excuse for their
conduct, that it was not their custom to smoke until they had
received some presents: but a few Mexican <i>cigarritos</i> being
produced, most of them took a whiff, as if under the impression
that to smoke cigars was no pledge of friendship.</p>

<p>Lieut. Bowman now desired us to broach the subject of
peace and amity betwixt the Comanches and our people,
and to invite them to visit the 'Capitan Grande' at Washington,
and enter into a perpetual treaty to that effect; but they
would not then converse on the subject. In fact, the interpreter
inquired, "Are we not at war?—how can we go to
see the Capitan Grande?" We knew they held themselves
at war with Mexico and Texas, and probably had mistaken
us for Texans, which had no doubt caused the interpreter
to speak so emphatically of their immense numbers. Upon
this we explained to them that the United States was a distinct
government {40} and at peace with the Comanches.
As an earnest of our friendly disposition, we then produced
some scarlet cloth, with a small quantity of vermilion,
tobacco, beads, etc., which being distributed among them,
they very soon settled down into a state of placidness and
contentment. Indeed, it will be found, that, with wild
Indians, presents are always the corner-stone of friendship.
"We are rejoiced," at last said the elder chief with a ceremonious
air, "our hearts are glad that you have arrived among
us: it makes our eyes laugh to see Americans walk in our
land. We will notify our old and young men—our boys <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg127"></a>[p127]</span>
and our maidens—our women and children,—that they
may come to trade with you. We hope you will speak well
of us to your people, that more of them may hunt the way
to our country, for we like to trade with the white man."
This was delivered in Comanche, but translated into Spanish
by the interpreter, who, although a full Indian, had lived
several years among the Mexicans and spoke that language
tolerably well. Our 'big talk' lasted several hours, after
which the Indians retired to sleep. The next morning, after
renewing their protestations of friendship, they took their
departure, the principal chief saying, "Tell the Capitan
Grande that when he pleases to call us we are all ready to
go to see him."</p>

<p>The project of bringing some of the chiefs of these wild
prairie tribes to Washington city, has been entertained, but
never yet carried {41} into effect. The few who have penetrated
as far as Fort Gibson, or perhaps to a frontier village,
have probably left with more unfavorable impressions than
they had before. Believing the former to be our great
Capital, and the most insignificant among the latter, our
largest cities, they have naturally come to the conclusion
that they surpass us in numbers and power, if not in wealth
and grandeur. I have no doubt that the chiefs of the Comanches
and other prairie tribes, if rightly managed, might
be induced to visit our veritable 'Capitan Grande,' and our
large cities, which would doubtless have a far better effect
than all the treaties of peace that could be concluded with
them for an age to come. They would then 'see with their
own eyes and hear with their own ears' the magnificence
and power of the whites, which would inspire them at once
with respect and fear.</p>

<p>This was on the 7th of June. About noon, Lieut. Bowman
and his command finally took leave of us, and at the same
time we resumed our forward march. This separation was <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg128"></a>[p128]</span>
truly painful: not so much on account of the loss we were
about to experience, in regard to the protection afforded us
by the troops (which, to say the truth, was more needed now
than it had ever been before), as for the necessity of parting
with a friend, who had endeared himself to us all by his
affable deportment, his social manners and accommodating
disposition. Ah! little did we think then that we should
never see that gallant officer more! {42} So young, so robust,
and so healthy, little did we suspect that the sound of that
voice which shouted so vigorously in responding to our
parting salute in the desert, would never greet our ears again!
But such was Fate's decree! Although he arrived safely
at Fort Gibson, in a few short weeks he fell a victim to disease.</p>

<p>There were perhaps a few timid hearts that longed to
return with the dragoons, and ever and anon a wistful
glance would be cast back at the receding figures in the
distance. The idea of a handful of thirty-four men having
to travel without guide or protection through a dreary wilderness,
peopled by thousands of savages who were just as likely
to be hostile as friendly, was certainly very little calculated
to produce agreeable impressions. Much to the credit of
our men, however, the escort was no sooner out of sight than
the timorous regained confidence, and all seemed bound
together by stronger ties than before. All we feared were
ambuscades or surprise; to guard against which, it was only
necessary to redouble our vigilance.</p>

<p>On the following day, while we were enjoying our noon's
rest upon a ravine of the Canadian, several parties of Indians,
amounting altogether to about three hundred souls, including
women and children, made their appearance. They belonged
to the same band of Comanches with whom we had
had so agreeable an intercourse, and had brought several
mules in the expectation of driving a trade with us. The
squaws and papooses {43} were so anxious to gratify their <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg129"></a>[p129]</span>
curiosity, and so very soon began to give such striking manifestations
of their pilfering propensities, that, at the request
of the chiefs, we carried some goods at a little distance,
where a trade was opened, in hopes of attracting their attention.
One woman, I observed, still lingered among the
wagons, who, from certain peculiarities of features, struck
me very forcibly as not being an Indian. In accordance
with this impression I addressed her in Spanish, and was
soon confirmed in all my suspicions. She was from the
neighborhood of Matamoros, and had been married to a
Comanche since her captivity. She did not entertain the
least desire of returning to her own people.</p>

<p>Similar instances of voluntary captivity have frequently
occurred. Dr. Sibley, in a communication to the War
Department, in 1805, relates an affecting case, which shows
how a sensitive female will often prefer remaining with her
masters, rather than encounter the horrible ordeal of ill-natured
remarks to which she would inevitably be exposed
on being restored to civilized life.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The Comanches, some
twenty years previous, having kidnapped the daughter of
the Governor-General of Chihuahua, the latter transmitted
$1000 to a trader to procure her ransom. This was soon
effected, but to the astonishment of all concerned, the unfortunate
girl refused to leave the Indians. She sent word to her
father, that they had disfigured her by tattooing; that she was
married and perhaps <i>enceinte</i>; {44} and that she would be
more unhappy by returning to her father under these circumstances
than by remaining where she was.</p>

<p>My attention was next attracted by a sprightly lad, ten
or twelve years old, whose nationality could scarcely be
detected under his Indian guise. But, though quite 'Indianized,'
he was exceedingly polite. I inquired of him in Spanish, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg130"></a>[p130]</span>
"Are you not a Mexican?" "Yes, sir,—I once was."
"What is your name?" "Bernardino Saenz, sir, at your
service." "When and where were you taken?" "About
four years ago, at the Hacienda de las Animas, near Parral."
"Shan't we buy you and take you to your people?—we
are going thither." At this he hesitated a little, and then
answered in an affecting tone, "<dfn>No, señor; ya soy demasiado
bruto para vivir entre los Cristianos</dfn>" (O, no, sir; I am now
too much of a brute to live among Christians); adding that
his owner was not there, and that he knew the Indian in
whose charge he came would not sell him.</p>

<p>The Hacienda de las Animas is in the department of
Chihuahua, some fifteen miles from the city of Parral, a
much larger place than Santa Fé. Notwithstanding this,
about three hundred Comanches made a bold inroad into
the very heart of the settlements—laid waste the unfortunate
hacienda, killing and capturing a considerable number—and
remained several days in the neighborhood, committing
all sorts of outrages. This occurred in 1835. I happened
to be in Chihuahua {45} at the time, and very well remember
the bustle and consternation that prevailed. A thousand
volunteers were raised, commanded by the governor himself,
who 'hotly pursued' the enemy during their tardy retreat;
but returned with the usual report—"<dfn>No les pudimos
alcanzar</dfn>,"—we could not overtake them.</p>

<p>Out of half a dozen Mexican captives that happened to
be with our new visitors, we only met with one who manifested
the slightest inclination to abandon Indian life. This
was a stupid boy about fifteen years of age, who had probably
been roughly treated on account of his laziness. We very
soon struck a bargain with his owner, paying about the price
of a mule for the little outcast, whom I sent to his family as
soon as we reached Chihuahua. Notwithstanding the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg131"></a>[p131]</span>
inherent stupidity of my <i>protégé</i>, I found him abundantly
grateful—much to his credit be it spoken—for the little
service I had been able to render him.</p>

<p>We succeeded in purchasing several mules which cost us
between ten and twenty dollars worth of goods apiece. In
Comanche trade the main trouble consists in fixing the price
of the first animal. This being settled by the chiefs, it often
happens that mule after mule is led up and the price received
without further cavil. Each owner usually wants a general
assortment; therefore the price must consist of several items,
as a blanket, a looking-glass, an awl, a flint, a little tobacco,
vermillion, beads, etc.</p>

<p>Our trade with the new batch of Comanches {46} being
over, they now began to depart as they had come, in small
parties, without bidding us adieu, or even informing us of
their intention, it being the usual mode of taking leave among
Indians, to depart <i>sans cérémonie</i>, and as silently as possible.</p>

<p>The Santa Fé caravans have generally avoided every
manner of trade with the wild Indians, for fear of being
treacherously dealt with during the familiar intercourse
which necessarily ensues. This I am convinced is an
erroneous impression; for I have always found, that savages
are much less hostile to those with whom they trade, than to
any other people. They are emphatically fond of traffic,
and, being anxious to encourage the whites to come among
them, instead of committing depredations upon those with
whom they trade, they are generally ready to defend them
against every enemy.</p>

<p>The Comanches having all disappeared, we resumed our
march, and soon emerged into an open plain or <i>mesa</i> which
was one of the most monotonous I had ever seen, there being
not a break, not a hill nor valley, nor even a shrub to obstruct
the view. The only thing which served to turn us
from a direct course pursued by the compass, was the innumerable
ponds which bespeckled the plain, and which
kept us at least well supplied with water. Many of these
ponds seem to have grown out of 'buffalo wallows,'—a
term used on the Prairies to designate a sink made by the
buffalo's pawing the earth for the purpose of obtaining a
smooth dusty surface to roll upon.</p>

<p>{48} After three or four days of weary travel over this level
plain, the picturesque valley of the Canadian burst once
more upon our view, presenting one of the most magnificent
sights I had ever beheld. Here rose a perpendicular cliff,
in all the majesty and sublimity of its desolation;—there
another sprang forward as in the very act of losing its balance
and about to precipitate itself upon the vale below;—a little
further on, a pillar with crevices and cornices so curiously
formed as easily to be mistaken for the work of art; while
a thousand other objects grotesquely and fantastically
arranged, and all shaded in the sky-bound perspective by
the blue ridge-like brow of the <i>mesa</i> far beyond the Canadian, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg133"></a>[p133]</span>
constituted a kind of chaotic space where nature seemed to
have indulged in her wildest caprices. Such was the confusion
of ground-swells and eccentric cavities, that it was
altogether impossible to determine whereabouts the channel
of the Canadian wound its way among them.</p>

<p>It would seem that these mesas might once have extended
up to the margin of the stream, leaving a <dfn>cañon</dfn> or chasm
through which the river flowed, as is still the case in some
other places. But the basis of the plain not having been
sufficiently firm to resist the action of the waters, these have
washed and cut the bordering <dfn>cejas</dfn> or brows into all the
shapes they now present. The buffalo and other animals
have no doubt assisted in these transmutations. Their
deep-worn paths over the {49} brows of the plains, form
channels for the descending rains; which are soon washed
into the size of ravines—and even considerable creeks.
The beds of these continue to be worn down until veins of
lasting water are opened, and constant-flowing streams thus
established. Numerous were the embryo rivulets which
might be observed forming in this way along the borders of
those streams. The frequent isolated benches and mounds,
whose tabular summits are on a level with the adjacent
plains, and appear entirely of a similar formation, indicate
that the intermediate earth has been washed away, or
removed by some other process of nature—all seeming to
give plausibility to our theory.</p>

<p>It was somewhere in this vicinity that a small party of
Americans experienced a terrible calamity in the winter of
1832-3, on their way home; and as the incident had the tendency
to call into play the most prominent features of the Indian
character, I will digress so far here as to relate the facts.</p>

<p>The party consisted of twelve men, chiefly citizens of
Missouri. Their baggage and about ten thousand dollars
in specie were packed upon mules. They took the route of <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg134"></a>[p134]</span>
the Canadian river, fearing to venture on the northern
prairies at that season of the year. Having left Santa Fé
in December, they had proceeded without accident thus
far, when a large body of Comanches and Kiawas were seen
advancing towards them. Being well acquainted with the
treacherous and pusillanimous {50} disposition of those races,
the traders prepared at once for defence; but the savages
having made a halt at some distance, began to approach one
by one, or in small parties, making a great show of friendship
all the while, until most of them had collected on the spot.
Finding themselves surrounded in every direction, the
travellers now began to move on, in hopes of getting rid of
the intruders: but the latter were equally ready for the start;
and, mounting their horses, kept jogging on in the same
direction. The first act of hostility perpetrated by the
Indians proved fatal to one of the American traders named
Pratt, who was shot dead while attempting to secure two
mules which had become separated from the rest. Upon
this, the companions of the slain man immediately dismounted
and commenced a fire upon the Indians, which was
warmly returned, whereby another man of the name of
Mitchell was killed.</p>

<p>By this time the traders had taken off their packs and piled
them around for protection; and now falling to work with
their hands, they very soon scratched out a trench deep
enough to protect them from the shot of the enemy. The
latter made several desperate charges, but they seemed too
careful of their own personal safety, notwithstanding the
enormous superiority of their numbers, to venture too near
the rifles of the Americans. In a few hours all the animals of
the traders were either killed or wounded, but no personal
damage was done to the remaining ten men, {51} with the
exception of a wound in the thigh received by one, which
was not at the time considered dangerous. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg135"></a>[p135]</span></p>

<p>During the siege, the Americans were in great danger of perishing
from thirst, as the Indians had complete command of
all the water within reach. Starvation was not so much to be
dreaded; because, in case of necessity, they could live on the
flesh of their slain animals, some of which lay stretched close
around them. After being pent up for thirty-six hours in this
horrible hole, during which time they had seldom ventured
to raise their heads above the surface without being shot at,
they resolved to make a bold <i>sortie</i> in the night, as any death
was preferable to the fate which awaited them there. As
there was not an animal left that was at all in a condition
to travel, the proprietors of the money gave permission to all
to take and appropriate to themselves whatever amount each
man could safely undertake to carry. In this way a few
hundred dollars were started with, of which, however, but
little ever reached the United States. The remainder was
buried deep in the sand, in hopes that it might escape the
cupidity of the savages; but to very little purpose, for they
were afterwards seen by some Mexican traders making a
great display of specie, which was without doubt taken from
this unfortunate <i>cache</i>.</p>

<p>With every prospect of being discovered, overtaken, and
butchered, but resolved to sell their lives as dearly as possible,
they at last {52} emerged from their hiding-place, and moved
on silently and slowly until they found themselves beyond
the purlieus of the Indian camps. Often did they look back
in the direction where from three to five hundred savages
were supposed to watch their movements, but, much to their
astonishment, no one appeared to be in pursuit. The
Indians, believing no doubt that the property of the traders
would come into their hands, and having no amateur predilection
for taking scalps at the risk of losing their own,
appeared willing enough to let the spoliated adventurers
depart without further molestation. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg136"></a>[p136]</span></p>

<p>The destitute travellers having run themselves short of
provisions, and being no longer able to kill game for want
of materials to load their rifles with, they were very soon
reduced to the necessity of sustaining life upon roots, and
the tender bark of trees. After travelling for several days
in this desperate condition, with lacerated feet, and utter
prostration of mind and body, they began to disagree among
themselves about the route to be pursued, and eventually
separated into two distinct parties. Five of these unhappy
men steered a westward course, and after a succession of
sufferings and privations which almost surpassed belief, they
reached the settlements of the Creek Indians, near the
Arkansas river, where they were treated with great kindness
and hospitality. The other five wandered about in the
greatest state of distress and bewilderment, and only two
{53} finally succeeded in getting out of the mazes of the
wilderness. Among those who were abandoned to their
fate, and left to perish thus miserably, was a Mr. Schenck,
the same individual who had been shot in the thigh; a gentleman
of talent and excellent family connections, who was
a brother, as I am informed, of the Hon. Mr. Schenck, at
present a member of Congress from Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>But let us resume our journey. We had for some days,
while travelling along the course of the Canadian, been in
anxious expectation of reaching a point from whence there
was a cart-road to Santa Fé, made by the Ciboleros; but
being constantly baffled and disappointed in this hope,
serious apprehensions began to be entertained by some of <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg137"></a>[p137]</span>
the party that we might after all be utterly lost. In this
emergency, one of our Mexicans who pretended to be a great
deal wiser than the rest, insisted that we were pursuing a
wrong direction, and that every day's march only took us
further from Santa Fé. There appeared to be so much
plausibility in his assertion, as he professed a perfect knowledge
of all the country around, that many of our men were
almost ready to mutiny,—to take the command from the
hands of my brother and myself and lead us southward in
search of the Colorado, into the fearful <i>Llano Estacado</i>,
where we would probably have perished.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> But our observations
of the latitude, which we took very frequently, as
well as the course we were pursuing, completely contradicted
the {54} Mexican wiseacre. A few days afterwards we were
overtaken by a party of <dfn>Comancheros</dfn>, or Mexican Comanche
traders, when we had the satisfaction of learning that we were
in the right track.</p>

<p>These men had been trading with the band of Comanches
we had lately met, and learning from them that we had
passed on, they had hastened to overtake us, so as to obtain
our protection against the savages, who, after selling their
animals to the Mexicans, very frequently take forcible
possession of them again, before the purchasers have been
able to reach their homes. These parties of <i>Comancheros</i>
are usually composed of the indigent and rude classes of
the frontier villages, who collect together, several times a
year, and launch upon the plains with a few trinkets and
trumperies of all kinds, and perhaps a bag of bread and
may-be another of <i>pinole</i>, which they barter away to the
savages for horses and mules. The entire stock of an individual
trader very seldom exceeds the value of twenty dollars,
with which he is content to wander about for several months, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg138"></a>[p138]</span>
and glad to return home with a mule or two, as the proceeds
of his traffic.</p>

<p>These Mexican traders had much to tell us about the
Comanches: saying, that they were four or five thousand in
number, with perhaps a thousand warriors, and that the
fiery young men had once determined to follow and attack
us; but that the chiefs and sages had deterred them, by
stating that our cannons {55} could kill to the distance of
many miles, and shoot through hills and rocks and destroy
everything that happened to be within their range. The
main object of our visitors, however, seemed to be to raise
themselves into importance by exaggerating the perils we
had escaped from. That they had considered themselves
in great jeopardy, there could be no doubt whatever, for,
in their anxiety to overtake us, they came very near killing
their animals.</p>

<p>It was a war-party of this band of Comanches that paid
the 'flying visit' to Bent's Fort on the Arkansas river, to
which Mr. Farnham alludes in his trip to Oregon.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> A
band of the same Indians also fell in with the caravan from
Missouri, with whom they were for a while upon the verge
of hostilities.</p>

<p>The next day we passed the afternoon upon a ravine
where we found abundance of water, but to our great surprise
our animals refused to drink. Upon tasting the water,
we found it exceedingly nauseous and bitter; far more <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg139"></a>[p139]</span>
repugnant to some palates than a solution of Epsom salts.
It is true that the water had been a little impregnated with
the same loathsome substance for several days; but we
had never found it so bad before. The salinous compound
which imparts this savor, is found in great abundance in
the vicinity of the table-plain streams of New Mexico, and
is known to the natives by the name of <dfn>salitre</dfn>.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> We {56} had
the good fortune to find in the valley, a few sinks filled by
recent rains, so that actually we experienced no great inconvenience
from the want of fresh water. As far as our own
personal necessities were concerned, we were abundantly
supplied; it being an unfailing rule with us to carry in each
wagon a five-gallon keg always filled with water, in order to
guard against those frightful contingencies which so frequently
occur on the Prairies. In truth upon leaving one watering
place, we never knew where we would find the next.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June we pitched our camp upon the north
bank of the Canadian or Colorado, in latitude <span
class="fraction">35° 24′</span>
according to a meridian altitude of Saturn. On the following
day, I left the caravan, accompanied by three Comancheros,
and proceeded at a more rapid pace towards Santa
Fé. This was rather a hazardous journey, inasmuch as we
were still within the range of the Pawnee and Comanche
war-parties, and my companions were men in whom I could
not repose the slightest confidence, except for piloting;
being fully convinced that in case of meeting with an enemy,
they would either forsake or deliver me up, just as it might
seem most conducive to their own interest and safety. All
I had to depend upon were my fire-arms, which could hardly
fail to produce an impression in my favor; for, thanks to
Mr. Colt's invention, I carried thirty-six charges ready-loaded,
which I could easily fire at the rate of {57} a dozen <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg140"></a>[p140]</span>
per minute. I do not believe that any band of those timorous
savages of the western prairies would venture to approach
even a single man, under such circumstances. If,
according to an old story of the frontier, an Indian supposed
that a white man fired both with his tomahawk and scalping
knife, to account for the execution done by a brace of
pistols, thirty-six shots discharged in quick succession would
certainly overawe them as being the effect of some great
medicine.</p>

<p>As we jogged merrily along, I often endeavored to while
away the time by catechising my three companions in relation
to the topography of the wild region we were traversing;
but I soon found, that, like the Indians, these ignorant
rancheros have no ideas of distances, except as compared
with time or with some other distance. They will tell you
that you may arrive at a given place by the time the sun
reaches a certain point: otherwise, whether it be but half
a mile or half a day's ride to the place inquired for, they are
as apt to apply <dfn>está cerquita</dfn> (it is close by), or <dfn>está lejos</dfn> (it
is far off), to the one as to the other, just as the impression
happens to strike them, when compared with some other
point more or less distant. This often proves a source of
great annoyance to foreign travellers, as I had an opportunity
of experiencing before my arrival. In giving directions,
these people—in fact, the lower classes of Mexicans generally—are
also in the habit of using very odd gesticulations,
altogether {58} peculiar to themselves. Instead of
pointing with their hands and fingers, they generally employ
the mouth, which is done by thrusting out the lips in the
direction of the spot, or object, which the inquirer wishes
to find out—accompanied by <i>aquí</i> or <i>allí está</i>. This habit
of substituting labial gestures for the usual mode of indicating,
has grown from the use of the <i>sarape</i>, which keeps
their hands and arms perpetually confined. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg141"></a>[p141]</span></p>

<p>From the place where we left the wagons, till we reached
the <dfn>Angostura</dfn>, or narrows,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> (a distance of 60 miles), we
had followed a plain cart-road, which seemed everywhere
passable for wagons. Here, however, we found the point
of a table plain projecting abruptly against the river, so as
to render it impossible for wagons to pass without great
risk. The huge masses of solid rock, which occur in this
place, and the rugged cliffs or brows of the table lands which
rise above them, appear to have been mistaken by a detachment
of the Texan Santa Fé expedition, for spurs of the
Rocky Mountains; an error which was rational enough, as
they not unfrequently tower to the height of two thousand
feet above the valley, and are often as rocky and rough as
the rudest heaps of trap-rock can make them. By ascending
the main summit of these craggy promontories, however,
the eastern ridge of the veritable Rocky Mountains may be
seen, still very far off in the western horizon, with a widespread
and apparently level table plain, intervening and
extending in every direction, {59} as far as the eye can reach;
for even the deep-cut chasms of the intersecting rivers are
rarely visible except one be upon their very brink.</p>

<p>Upon expressing my fears that our wagons would not be
able to pass the <i>Angostura</i> in safety, my comrades informed
me that there was an excellent route, of which no previous
mention had been made, passing near the <dfn>Cerro de Tucumcari</dfn>,
a round mound plainly visible to the southward.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> After
several vain efforts to induce some of the party to carry a <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg142"></a>[p142]</span>
note back to my brother, and to pilot the caravan through
the Tucumcari route, one of them, known as Tio Baca,
finally proposed to undertake the errand for a bounty of
ten dollars, besides high wages till they should reach the
frontier. His conditions being accepted, he set out after
breakfast, not, however, without previously recommending
himself to the Virgin Guadalupe, and all the saints in the
calendar, and desiring us to remember him in our prayers.
Notwithstanding his fears, however, he arrived in perfect
safety, and I had the satisfaction of learning afterward that
my brother found the new route everything he could have
desired.</p>

<p>I continued my journey westward with my two remaining
companions; but, owing to their being provided with a relay
of horses, they very soon left me to make the balance of the
travel alone—though yet in a region haunted by hostile
savages. On the following day, about the hour of twelve,
as I was pursuing a horse-path along the course of the {60}
Rio Pecos, near the frontier settlements, I met with a shepherd,
of whom I anxiously inquired the distance to San
Miguel. "O, it is just there," responded the man of sheep.
"Don't you see that point of mesa yonder? It is just beyond
that." This welcome information cheered me greatly; for,
owing to the extraordinary transparency of the atmosphere,
it appeared to me that the distance could not exceed two
or three miles. "<dfn>Está cerquita</dfn>," exclaimed the shepherd
as I rode off; "<dfn>ahora está V. allá</dfn>"—"it is close by; you will
soon be there."</p>

<p>I set off at as lively a pace as my jaded steed could carry
me, confident of taking dinner in San Miguel.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Every
ridge I turned I thought must be the last, and thus I jogged
on, hoping and anticipating my future comforts till the
shades of evening began to appear; when I descended into <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg143"></a>[p143]</span>
the valley of the Pecos, which, although narrow, is exceedingly
fertile and beautifully lined with verdant fields, among
which stood a great variety of mud cabins. About eight
o'clock, I called at one of these cottages and again inquired
the distance to San Miguel; when a swarthy-looking ranchero
once more saluted mine ears with "<i>Está cerquita; ahora está
V. allá</i>." Although the distance was designated in precisely
the same words used by the shepherd eight hours before, I
had the consolation at least of believing that I was something
nearer. After spurring on for a couple of miles over
a rugged road, I at last reached the long-sought village.</p>

<p>{61} The next day, I hired a Mexican to carry some flour
back to meet the wagons; for our party was by this time
running short of provisions. In fact, we should long before
have been in danger of starvation, had it not been for our
oxen; for we had not seen a buffalo since the day we first
met with the Comanches. Some of our cattle being in good
plight, and able, as we were, to spare a few from our teams,
we made beef of them when urged by necessity: an extra
advantage in ox teams on these perilous expeditions.</p>

<p>On the 25th of June I arrived safely at Santa Fé,—but
again rode back to meet the wagons, which did not reach
the capital till the 4th of July. We did not encounter a very
favorable reception from 'his majesty,' Gov. Armijo. He
had just established his arbitrary impost of $500 per wagon,
which bore rather heavily upon us; for we had an overstock
of coarse articles which we had merely brought along for
the purpose of increasing the strength of our company, by
adding to the number of our wagons.</p>

<p>But these little troubles in a business way, were entirely
drowned in the joyful sensations arising from our safe arrival,
after so long and so perilous an expedition. Considering
the character and our ignorance of the country over which
we had travelled, we had been exceedingly successful. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg144"></a>[p144]</span>
Instances are certainly rare of heavily-laden wagons' having
been conducted, without a guide, through an unexplored
desert; and yet we {62} performed the trip without any
important accident—without encountering any very difficult
passes—without suffering for food or for water.</p>

<p>We had hoped that at least a few days of rest and quiet
recreation might have been allowed us after our arrival;
for relaxation was sorely needed at the end of so long a
journey and its concomitant privations: but it was ordered
otherwise. We had scarcely quartered ourselves within the
town before a grand 'flare-up' took place between Gov.
Armijo and the foreigners<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> in Santa Fé, which, for a little
while, bid fair to result in open hostilities. It originated in
the following circumstances.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1837-8, a worthy young American, named
Daley, was murdered at the Gold Mines, by a couple of
villains, solely for plunder. The assassins were arrested,
when they confessed their guilt; but, in a short time, they
were permitted to run at large again, in violation of every
principle of justice or humanity. About this time they were
once more apprehended, however, by the interposition of
foreigners: and, at the solicitation of the friends of the
deceased, a memorial from the Americans in Santa Fé was
presented to Armijo, representing the injustice of permitting
the murderers of their countrymen to go unpunished; and
praying that the culprits might {63} be dealt with according
to law. But the governor affected to consider the affair as
a conspiracy; and, collecting his ragamuffin militia, attempted
to intimidate the petitioners. The foreigners were
now constrained to look to their defence, as they saw that <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg145"></a>[p145]</span>
no justice was to be expected. Had Armijo persisted,
serious consequences might have ensued; but seeing the
'conspirators' firm, he sent an apology, affecting to have
misconstrued their motives, and promising that the laws
should be duly executed upon the murderers.</p>

<p>Besides the incentives of justice and humanity, foreigners
felt a deep interest in the execution of this promise. But a
few years previous, another person had been assassinated
and robbed at the same place; yet the authorities having
taken no interest in the matter, the felons were never discovered;
and now, should these assassins escape the merited forfeit
of their atrocious crime, it was evident there would be
no future security for our lives and property. But the governor's
<em>due execution of the laws</em> consisted in retaining them
a year or two in nominal imprisonment, when they were
again set at liberty. Besides these, other foreigners have
been murdered in New Mexico with equal impunity:—all
which contrasts very strikingly with the manner our courts
of justice have since dealt with those who killed Chavez, in
1843, on the Santa Fé road.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>After passing the custom-house ordeal, and exchanging
some of our merchandise for 'Eagle Dollars'—an operation
which occupied us several weeks, I prepared to set out for <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg146"></a>[p146]</span>
the Chihuahua market, whither a portion of our stock had
been designed. Upon this expedition I was obliged to
depart without my brother, who was laboring under the
'home fever,' and anxious to return to his family. "He that
hath wife and children," says Lord Bacon, "hath given
hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises,
either of virtue or mischief." Men under such bonds
are peculiarly unfitted for the chequered life of a Santa Fé
trader. The domestic hearth, {65} with all its sacred and
most endearing recollections, is sure to haunt them in the
hour of trial, and almost every step of their journey is apt
to be attended by melancholy reflections of home and
domestic dependencies.</p>

<p>Before starting on this new journey I deem it proper to
make a few observations relative to the general character
of the <i>Chihuahua Trade</i>. I have already remarked, that
much surprise has frequently been expressed by those who
are unacquainted with all the bearings of the case, that the
Missouri traders should take the circuitous route to Santa
Fé, instead of steering direct for Chihuahua, inasmuch as
the greatest portion of their goods is destined for the latter
city. But as Chihuahua never had any port of entry for
foreign goods till the last six or eight years, the market of
that department had to be supplied in a great measure from
Santa Fé. By opening the ports of El Paso and Presidio
del Norte,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> the commercial interest was so little affected,
that when Santa Anna's decree for closing them again was
issued, the loss was scarcely felt at all.</p>

<p>The mode of transmitting merchandise from the ports
to the interior, is very different from what it is in the United
States. It is not enough to have to pass the tedious ordeal <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg147"></a>[p147]</span>
of custom-houses on the frontier, and we have not only to
submit to a supervision and repayment of duty on arriving
at our point of destination, but our cargo is subject to scrutiny
at every town we have to pass through on our {66} journey.
Nor would it be advisable to forsake the main route in order
to avoid this tyrannical system of taxation; because, according
to the laws of the country, every <i>cargamento</i> which is
found out of the regular track (except in cases of unavoidable
necessity), is subject to confiscation, although accompanied
by the necessary custom-house documents.</p>

<p>There are also other risks and contingencies very little
dreamed of in the philosophy of the inexperienced trader.
Before setting out, the entire bill of merchandise has to be
translated into Spanish; when, duplicates of the translation
being presented to the custom-house, one is retained, while
the other, accompanied by the <dfn>guia</dfn> (a sort of clearance or
mercantile passport), is carried along with the cargo by the
conductor. The trader can have three points of destination
named in his <dfn>guia</dfn>, to either of which he may direct his course,
but to no others: while in the drawing up of the <dfn>factura</dfn>,
or invoice, the greatest care is requisite, as the slightest mistake,
even an accidental slip of the pen, might, according
to the terms of the law, subject the goods to confiscation.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The <i>guia</i> is not only required on leaving the ports for the
interior, but is indispensable to the safe conveyance of goods
from one department of the republic to another: nay, the
{67} simple transfer of property from town to town, and
from village to village, in the same department, is attended
by precisely the same proportion of risk, and requires the
same punctilious accuracy in the accompanying documents. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg148"></a>[p148]</span>
Even the produce and manufactures of the country are
equally subject to these embarrassing regulations. New
Mexico has no internal custom-houses, and is therefore exempt
from this rigorous provision; but from Chihuahua
south every village has its revenue officers; so that the same
stock of merchandise sometimes pays the internal duty at
least half-a-dozen times before the sale is completed.</p>

<p>Now, to procure this same <i>guia</i>, which is the cause of so
much difficulty and anxiety in the end, is no small affair.
Before the authorities condescend to draw a single line on
paper, the merchant must produce an endorser for the
<dfn>tornaguía</dfn>, which is a certificate from the custom-house to
which the cargo goes directed, showing that the goods have
been legally entered there. A failure in the return of this
document within a prescribed limit of time, subjects the
endorser to a forfeiture equal to the amount of the impost.
Much inconvenience and not a little risk are also occasioned
on this score by the irregularity—I may say, insecurity of
the mails.</p>

<p>Speaking of mails, I beg leave to observe, that there are no
conveniences of this kind in New Mexico, except on the
route from Santa Fé to Chihuahua, and these are very
{68} irregular and uncertain. Before the Indians had
obtained such complete possession of the highways through
the wilderness, the mails between these two cities were carried
semi-monthly; but now they are much less frequent,
being mere expresses, in fact, dispatched only when an occasion
offers. There are other causes, however, besides the
dread of marauding savages, which render the transportation
of the mails in New Mexico very insecure: I mean the dishonesty
of those employed in superintending them. Persons
known to be inimical to the post-master, or to the 'powers
that be,' and wishing to forward any communication to the
South, most generally either wait for private conveyance, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg149"></a>[p149]</span>
or send their letters to a post-office (the only one besides
that of Santa Fé in all New Mexico) some eighty miles
on the way; thus avoiding an overhauling at the capital.
Moreover, as the post-rider often carries the key
of the mail-bag (for want of a supply at the different
offices), he not unfrequently permits whomsoever will pay
him a trifling <i>douceur</i>, to examine the correspondence. I
was once witness to a case of this kind in the Jornada del
Muerto, where the entire mail was tumbled out upon the
grass, that an individual might search for letters, for which
luxury he was charged by the accommodating carrier the
moderate price of one dollar.</p>

<p>The <dfn>derecho de consumo</dfn> (the internal or consumption
duty) is an impost averaging nearly twenty per cent. on the
United States cost of {69} the bill. It supplies the place of a
direct tax for the support of the departmental government,
and is decidedly the most troublesome, if not the most oppressive
revenue system that ever was devised for internal
purposes. It operates at once as a drawback upon the
commercial prosperity of the country, and as a potent incentive
to fraudulent practices. The country people especially
have resort to every species of clandestine intercourse, to
escape this galling burden; for, every article of consumption
they carry to market, whether fish, flesh or fowl, as well as
fruit and vegetables, is taxed more or less; while another
impost is levied upon the goods they purchase with the
proceeds of their sales. This system, so beautifully entangled
with corruptions, is supported on the ground that it
supersedes direct taxation, which, in itself, is an evil that
the 'free and independent' people of Mexico would never
submit to. Besides the petty annoyances incidental upon
the laxity of custom-house regulations, no one can travel
through the country without a passport, which to free-born
Americans, is a truly insupportable nuisance. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg150"></a>[p150]</span></p>

<p>Having at last gone through with all the vexatious preparations
necessary for our journey, on the 22d of August we
started for Chihuahua. I fitted out myself but six wagons
for this market, yet joining in company with several other
traders, our little caravan again amounted to fourteen
wagons, with about forty men. Though our route lay
through {70} the interior of Northern Mexico, yet, on account
of the hostile savages which infest most of the country through
which we had to pass, it was necessary to unite in caravans of
respectable strength, and to spare few of those precautions
for safety which are required on the Prairies.</p>

<p>The road we travelled passes down through the settlements
of New Mexico for the first hundred and thirty miles, on
the east side of the Rio del Norte. Nevertheless, as there
was not an inn of any kind to be found upon the whole route,
we were constrained to put up with very primitive accommodations.
Being furnished from the outset, therefore,
with blankets and buffalo rugs for bedding, we were prepared
to bivouac, even in the suburbs of the villages, in the
open air; for in this dry and salubrious atmosphere it is
seldom that travellers go to the trouble of pitching tents.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
When travelling alone, however, or with but a comrade or
two, I have always experienced a great deal of hospitality
from the rancheros and villageois of the country. Whatever
sins these ignorant people may have to answer for, we must
accord to them at least two glowing virtues—gratitude and
hospitality. I have suffered like others, however, from one
very disagreeable custom which prevails {71} among them.
Instead of fixing a price for the services they bestow upon
travellers, they are apt to answer, "<dfn>Lo que guste</dfn>," or "<dfn>Lo</dfn> <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg151"></a>[p151]</span>
<dfn>que le dé la gana</dfn>" (whatever you please, or have a mind to
give), expecting, of course, that the liberal foreigner will give
more than their consciences would permit them to exact.</p>

<p>In about ten days' drive we passed the southernmost settlements
of New Mexico, and twenty or thirty miles further
down the river we came to the ruins of Valverde. This
village was founded about twenty years ago, in one of the
most fertile valleys of the Rio del Norte. It increased
rapidly in population, until it was invaded by the Navajoes,
when the inhabitants were obliged to abandon the place
after considerable loss, and it has never since been repeopled.
The bottoms of the valley, many of which are of rich alluvial
loam, have lain fallow ever since, and will perhaps continue
to be neglected until the genius of civilization shall have
spread its beneficent influences over the land. This soil is
the more valuable for cultivation on account of the facilities
for irrigation which the river affords; as it too frequently
happens that the best lands of the settlements remain
unfruitful for want of water.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Our next camping place deserving of mention was <i>Fray
Cristóbal</i>, which, like many others on the route, is neither
town nor village, but a simple isolated point on the river-bank—a
mere <dfn>parage</dfn>, or camping-ground. We had
already passed San Pascual, El Contadero, {72} and many
others, and we could hear Aleman, Robledo, and a dozen
such spoken of on the way, leading the stranger to imagine
that the route was lined with flourishing villages. The
arriero will tell one to hasten—"we must reach San Diego
before sleeping." We spur on perhaps with redoubled <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg152"></a>[p152]</span>
vigor, in hopes to rest at a town; but lo! upon arriving,
we find only a mere watering-place, without open ground
enough to graze the <i>caballada</i>. Thus every point along
these wilderness highways used as a camping-site, has
received a distinctive name, well known to every muleteer
who travels them. Many of these <dfn>parages</dfn>, without the
slightest vestige of human improvement, figure upon most
of the current maps of the day as towns and villages.
Yet there is not a single settlement (except of very recent
establishment) from those before mentioned to the vicinity
of El Paso, a distance of near two hundred miles.</p>

<p>We arrived at Fray Cristóbal<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> in the evening, but this
being the threshold of the famous <i>Jornada del Muerto</i>, we
deemed it prudent to let our animals rest here until the
following afternoon. The road over which we had hitherto
been travelling, though it sometimes traverses upland ridges
and undulating sections, runs generally near the border of the
river, and for the most part in its immediate valley: but here
it leaves the river and passes for nearly eighty miles over a
table-plain to the eastward of a small ledge of mountains,
whose western base is hugged {73} by the circuitous channel
of the Rio del Norte. The craggy cliffs which project from
these mountains render the eastern bank of the river altogether
impassable. As the direct route over the plain is
entirely destitute of water, we took the precaution to fill all
our kegs at Fray Cristóbal, and late in the afternoon we
finally set out. We generally find a great advantage in
travelling through these arid tracts of land in the freshness
of the evening, as the mules suffer less from thirst, and move <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg153"></a>[p153]</span>
on in better spirits—particularly in the season of warm
weather.</p>

<p>Early the next morning we found ourselves at the <dfn>Laguna
del Muerto</dfn>, or 'Dead Man's Lake,' where there was not even
a vestige of water. This <i>lake</i> is but a sink in the plain of
a few rods in diameter, and only filled with water during
the rainy season. The <i>marshes</i>, which are said by some
historians to be in this vicinity, are nowhere to be found:
nothing but the firmest and driest table land is to be seen
in every direction. To procure water for our thirsty animals
it is often necessary to make a halt here, and drive them to
the <dfn>Ojo del Muerto</dfn> (Dead Man's Spring), five or six miles
to the westward, in the very heart of the mountain ridge that
lay between us and the river. This region is one of the
favorite resorts of the Apaches, where many a poor arriero
has met with an untimely end. The route which leads to the
spring winds for two or three miles down a narrow cañon or
gorge, overhung on either side by abrupt precipices, {74} while
the various clefts and crags, which project their gloomy
brows over the abyss below, seem to invite the murderous
savage to deeds of horror and blood.</p>

<p>There is a tradition among the arrieros from which it
would appear that the only road known in ancient time about
the region of the <i>Jornada</i>, wound its circuitous course on the
western side of the river. To save distance, an intrepid
traveller undertook to traverse this desolate tract of land in
one day, but having perished in the attempt, it has ever
after borne the name of <dfn>La Jornada del Muerto</dfn>, 'the Dead
Man's Journey,' or, more strictly, 'the Day's Journey of the
Dead Man.' One thing appears very certain, that this
dangerous pass has cost the life of many travellers in days
of yore; and when we at last reached Robledo, a camping-site
upon the river, where we found abundance of wood and
water, we felt truly grateful that the arid <i>Jornada</i> had not <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg154"></a>[p154]</span>
been productive of more serious consequences to our party.
We now found ourselves within the department of Chihuahua,
as the boundary betwixt it and New Mexico passes
not far north of Robledo.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>We were still some sixty miles above Paso del Norte, but
the balance of the road now led down the river valley or
over the low bordering hills. During our journey between
this and El Paso we passed the ruins of several settlements,
which had formerly been the seats of opulence and prosperity,
but which have since been abandoned in consequence {75} of
the marauding incursions of the Apaches.</p>

<p>On the 12th of September we reached the usual ford of the
Rio del Norte, six miles above El Paso; but the river being
somewhat flushed we found it impossible to cross over with
our wagons. The reader will no doubt be surprised to
learn that there is not a single ferry on this 'Great River of
the North' till we approach the mouth. But how do people
cross it? Why, during three-fourths of the year it is everywhere
fordable, and when the freshet season comes on, each
has to remain on his own side, or swim, for canoes even are
very rare. But as we could neither swim our wagons and
merchandise, nor very comfortably wait for the falling of
the waters, our only alternative was to unload the vehicles,
and ferry the goods over in a little 'dug-out' about thirty
feet long and two feet wide, of which we were fortunate
enough to obtain possession.</p>

<p>We succeeded in finding a place shallow enough to haul
our empty wagons across: but for this good fortune we should
have been under the necessity of taking them to pieces (as
I had before done), and of ferrying them on the 'small craft' <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg155"></a>[p155]</span>
before mentioned. Half of a wagon may thus be crossed at
a time, by carefully balancing it upon the canoe, yet there
is of course no little danger of capsizing during the passage.</p>

<p>This river even when fordable often occasions a great
deal of trouble, being, like the Arkansas, embarrassed with
many quicksand {76} mires. In some places, if a wagon is
permitted to stop in the river but for a moment, it sinks to
the very body. Instances have occurred where it became
necessary, not only to drag out the mules by the ears and to
carry out the loading package by package, but to haul out
the wagon piece by piece—wheel by wheel.</p>

<p>On the 14th we made our entrance into the town of <i>El
Paso del Norte</i>,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> which is the northernmost settlement in
the department of Chihuahua. Here our cargo had to be
examined by a stern, surly officer, who, it was feared, would
lay an embargo on our goods upon the slightest appearance
of irregularity in our papers; but notwithstanding our gloomy
forebodings, we passed the ordeal without any difficulty.</p>

<p>The valley of El Paso is supposed to contain a population
of about four thousand inhabitants, scattered over the western
bottom of the Rio del Norte to the length of ten or twelve
miles. These settlements are so thickly interspersed with
vineyards, orchards, and corn-fields, as to present more the
appearance of a series of plantations than of a town: in fact,
only a small portion at the head of the valley, where the
<i>plaza pública</i> and parochial church are located, would seem
to merit this title. {77} Two or three miles above the <i>plaza</i>
there is a dam of stone and brush across the river, the purpose
of which is to turn the current into a dike or canal,
which conveys nearly half the water of the stream, during a <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg156"></a>[p156]</span>
low stage, through this well cultivated valley, for the irrigation
of the soil. Here we were regaled with the finest fruits
of the season: the grapes especially were of the most exquisite
flavor. From these the inhabitants manufacture a very
pleasant wine, somewhat resembling Malaga. A species of
<dfn>aguardiente</dfn> (brandy) is also distilled from the same fruit,
which, although weak, is of very agreeable flavor. These
liquors are known among Americans as 'Pass wine' and
'Pass whiskey,' and constitute a profitable article of trade,
supplying the markets of Chihuahua and New Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_106_106"
id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>As I have said before, the road from Santa Fé to El Paso
leads partly along the margin of the Rio del Norte, or across
the bordering hills and plains; but the <i>sierra</i> which separates
the waters of this river and those of the Rio Pecos was always
visible on our left. In some places it is cut up into detached
ridges, one of which is known as <dfn>Sierra Blanca</dfn>, in consequence
of its summit's being covered with snow till late in
the spring, and having all {78} the appearance of a glittering
white cloud. There is another still more picturesque ridge
further south, called <dfn>Los Organos</dfn>, presenting an immense
cliff of basaltic pillars, which bear some resemblance to the
pipes of an <i>organ</i>, whence the mountain derived its name.
Both these sierras are famous as being the strongholds of the
much-dreaded Apaches.</p>

<p>The mountains from El Paso northward are mostly clothed
with pine, cedar, and a dwarfish species of oak. The valleys
are timbered with cottonwood, and occasionally with <i>mezquite</i>,
which, however, is rarely found higher up than the
lower settlements of New Mexico. In the immediate vicinity <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg157"></a>[p157]</span>
of El Paso there is another small growth called <dfn>tornillo</dfn> (or
screw-wood), so denominated from a spiral pericarp, which,
though different in shape, resembles that of the mezquite in
flavor.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a
href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
The plains and highlands generally are of a
prairie character, and do not differ materially from those
of all Northern Mexico, which are almost everywhere completely
void of timber.</p>

<p>One of the most useful plants to the people of El Paso is
the <dfn>lechuguilla</dfn>, which abounds on the hills and mountain
sides of that vicinity, as well as in many other places from
thence southward.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Its blades, which resemble those of
the palmilla, being mashed, scraped, and washed, afford
very strong fibres like the common Manilla sea-grass, and
equally serviceable for the manufacture of ropes, and other
purposes.</p>

<p>{79} After leaving El Paso, our road branched off at an
angle of about two points to the westward of the river, the
city of Chihuahua being situated nearly a hundred miles to
the west of it. At the distance of about thirty miles we
reached <dfn>Los Médanos</dfn>, a stupendous ledge of sand-hills,
across which the road passes for about six miles. As teams
are never able to haul the loaded wagons over this region of
loose sand, we engaged an <i>atajo</i> of mules at El Paso, upon
which to convey our goods across. These Médanos consist of
huge hillocks and ridges of pure sand, in many places without
a vestige of vegetation. Through the lowest gaps between
the hills, the road winds its way.</p>

<p>What renders this portion of the route still more unpleasant
and fatiguing, is the great scarcity of water. All that is to <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg158"></a>[p158]</span>
be found on the road for the distance of more than sixty
miles after leaving El Paso, consists in two fetid springs or
pools, whose water is only rendered tolerable by necessity.
A little further on, however, we very unexpectedly encountered,
this time, quite a superabundance of this necessary
element. Just as we passed Lake Patos,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> we were struck
with astonishment at finding the road ahead of us literally
overflowed by an immense body of water, with a brisk current,
as if some great river had suddenly been conjured into
existence by the aid of supernatural arts. A considerable
time elapsed before we could unravel the mystery. At last
we discovered that a freshet had lately occurred {80} in the
streams that fed Lake Patos, and caused it to overflow its
banks, which accounted for this unwelcome visitation. We
had to flounder through the mud and water for several
hours, before we succeeded in getting across.</p>

<p>The following day we reached the <dfn>acequia</dfn> below Carrizal,
a small village with only three or four hundred inhabitants,
but somewhat remarkable as being the site of a <dfn>presidio</dfn>
(fort), at which is stationed a company of troops to protect
the country against the ravages of the Apaches, who, notwithstanding,
continue to lay waste the ranchos in the
vicinity, and to depredate at will within the very sight of the
fort.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>About twelve miles south of Carrizal there is one of the
most charming warm springs called Ojo Caliente, where we
arrived the next day. It forms a basin some thirty feet long
by about half that width, and just deep and warm enough
for a most delightful bath at all seasons of the year. Were
this spring (whose outlet forms a bold little rivulet) anywhere <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg159"></a>[p159]</span>
within the United States, it would doubtless soon be converted
into a place of fashionable resort. There appears to
be a somewhat curious phenomenon connected with this
spring. It proceeds, no doubt, from the little river of
Cármen, which passes within half a mile, and finally discharges
itself into the small lake of Patos before mentioned.
During the dry season, this stream disappears in the sand
some miles above the spring; and what medium it traverses
in its subterranean passage to impart {81} to it so high a
temperature, before breaking out in this fountain, would
afford to the geologist an interesting subject of inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>After fording the Rio Cármen, which, though usually
without a drop of water in its channel, we now found a very
turbulent stream, we did not meet with any object particularly
worthy of remark, until we reached the <dfn>Laguna de
Encinillas</dfn>.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a
href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
This lake is ten or twelve miles long by two
or three in width, and seems to have no outlet even during
the greatest freshets, though fed by several small constantly-flowing
streams from the surrounding mountains. The
water of this lake during the dry season is so strongly impregnated
with nauseous and bitter salts, as to render it
wholly unpalatable to man and beast. The most predominant
of these noxious substances is a species of alkali, known
there by the title of <dfn>tequesquite</dfn>. It is often seen oozing out
from the surface of marshy grounds, about the table plains
of all Northern Mexico, forming a grayish crust, and is
extensively used in the manufacture of soap, and sometimes
by the bakers even for raising bread. Here we had another
evidence of the alarming effects of the recent flood, the road
for several miles along the margin of the lake being <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg160"></a>[p160]</span>
completely inundated. It was, however, in the city of Chihuahua
itself that the disastrous consequences of the freshet were
most severely felt. Some inferior houses of <i>adobe</i> were so
much soaked by the rains, that they tumbled to the ground,
occasioning the loss of several lives.</p>

<p>{82} The valley of Encinillas is very extensive and fertile,
and is the locale of one of those princely estates which are
so abundant further south, and known by the name of
<dfn>Haciendas</dfn>. It abounds in excellent pasturage, and in
cattle of all descriptions. In former times, before the
Apaches had so completely devastated the country, the
herds which grazed in this beautiful valley presented much
the appearance of the buffalo of the plains, being almost as
wild and generally of dark color. Many of the proprietors
of these princely haciendas pride themselves in maintaining
a uniformity in the color of their cattle: thus some are found
stocked with black, others red, others white—or whatsoever
shade the owner may have taken a fancy to.</p>

<p>As we drew near to Chihuahua, our party had more the
appearance of a funeral procession than of a band of adventurers,
about to enter into the full fruition of 'dancing hopes,'
and the realization of 'golden dreams.' Every one was
uneasy as to what might be the treatment of the revenue
officers. For my own part, I had not quite forgotten sundry
annoyances and trials of temper I had been made to experience
in the season of 1837, on a similar occasion. Much
to our surprise, however, as well as delight, we were handled
with a degree of leniency by the custom-house deities, on
our arrival, that was almost incomprehensible. But the
charm which operated in our favor, when understood, was
very simple. A caravan had left Chihuahua direct {83} for
the United States, the spring previous, and was daily expected
back. The officers of the custom-house were already
compromised by certain cogent arguments to receive the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg161"></a>[p161]</span>
proprietors of this caravan with striking marks of favor, and
the <i>Señor Administrador de Rentas</i>, Zuloaga himself, was
expecting an <i>ancheta</i> of goods. Therefore, had they treated
us with their wonted severity, the contrast would have been
altogether too glaring.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>We arrived at Chihuahua on the first of October, after a
trip of forty days, with wagons much more heavily laden
than when we started from the United States. The whole
distance from Santa Fé to Chihuahua is about 550 miles,—being
reckoned 320 to Paso del Norte, and 230 from thence
to Chihuahua. The road from El Paso south is mostly firm
and beautiful, with the exception of the sand-hills before
spoken of; and is only rendered disagreeable by the scarcity
and occasional ill-savor of the water. The route winds over
an elevated plain among numerous detached ridges of low
mountains—spurs, as it were, of the main Cordilleras,
which lie at a considerable distance to the westward. Most
of these extensive intermediate plains, though in many places
of fertile looking soil, must remain wholly unavailable for
agricultural purposes, on account of their natural aridity and
a total lack of water for irrigation.</p>

<p>The patient reader who may have accompanied me thus
far, without murmuring at the dryness of some of the details,
will perhaps pardon me for presenting here a brief account
of a trip which I made to <i>Aguascalientes</i>, in the interior of
Northern Mexico, in the year 1835, and which the arrangement
I have adopted has prevented me from introducing
before, in its chronological order.</p>

<p>The trade of the South constitutes a very important
branch of the commerce of the country, in which foreigners,
as well as natives, {85} are constantly embarking. It is
customary for most of those who maintain mercantile establishments
in Chihuahua, to procure assortments of Mexican
fabrics from the manufactories of Leon, Aguascalientes, and
other places of the same character in the more southern districts
of the republic. At certain seasons of the year, here
are held regular <dfn>ferias</dfn>, at which the people assemble in
great numbers, as well of sellers as of purchasers. There
are some eight or ten of these annual fairs held in the republic,
each of which usually lasts a week or more. It was
about as much, however, from a desire to behold the sunny
districts of the South, as for commercial purposes, that I
undertook this expedition in 1835; and as my engagements
have not permitted me to revisit this section since, the few <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg163"></a>[p163]</span>
notes of interest I was then able to collect, seem to come
more appropriately in this part of my work than in any
other place that I could readily select.</p>

<p>I set out from Chihuahua on the 26th of February, 1835.
My party consisted of four men (including myself) and two
empty wagons—not a very formidable escort to protect
our persons as well as specie and bullion (the only transmissible
currency of the country) against the bands of robbers
which at all times infest that portion of our route that
lay south of Durango. From Chihuahua to that city the
road was rendered still more perilous by the constant hostilities
of the Indians. On the 7th of March, however, we
arrived, without {86} accident, at the town of Cerro Gordo,
the northernmost settlement in the department of Durango;
and the following day we reached La Zarca, which is the
principal village of one of the most extensive haciendas in
the North. So immense is the amount of cattle on this
estate, that, as it was rumored, the proprietor once offered
to sell the whole hacienda, stock, etc., for the consideration
alone of fifty cents for each head of cattle found on the estate;
but that no person has ever yet been able or willing to muster
sufficient capital to take up the offer. It is very likely, however,
that if such a proposition was ever made, the proprietor
intended to include all his stock of rats and mice,
reptiles and insects—in short, every genus of 'small cattle'
on his premises. This estate covers a territory of perhaps
a hundred miles in length, which comprises several flourishing
villages.</p>

<p>In two days more, we reached Rio Nazas, a beautiful
little river that empties itself into Lake Cayman.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Rio <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg164"></a>[p164]</span>
Nazas has been celebrated for the growth of cotton, which,
owing to the mildness of the climate, is sometimes planted
fresh only every three or four years. The light frosts of
winter seldom destroy more than the upper portion of the
stalk, so that {87} the root is almost perennial. About
twenty-five miles further, we stopped at the mining village of
La Noria, where we were obliged to purchase water for our
mules—a novel expense to the American traveller, but
scarcely to be complained of, inasmuch as the water had to
be drawn from wells with a great deal of labor. It is not
unusual, also, for the proprietors of haciendas to demand
remuneration for the pasturage on the open plains, consumed
by the animals of travellers—a species of exaction
which one never hears of further north.</p>

<p>Our next stopping-place was Cuencamé, which may well
be called the Village of Churches: for, although possessing
a very small population, there are five or six edifices of this
description.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> As I had business to transact at Durango,
which is situated forty or fifty miles westward of the main
Southern road, I now pursued a direct route for that city,
where I arrived on the 16th of March.</p>

<p>Durango is one of the handsomest cities in the North, with
a population of about 20,000. It is situated in a level plain,
surrounded in every direction by low mountains. It presents
two or three handsome squares, with many fine edifices and
some really splendid churches. The town is supplied with
water for irrigating the gardens, and for many other ordinary
purposes, by several open aqueducts, which lead through
the streets, from a large spring, a mile or {88} two distant; but
as these are kept filthy by the offal that is thrown into them,
the inhabitants who are able to buy it, procure most of their <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg165"></a>[p165]</span>
water for drinking and culinary purposes, from the <dfn>aguadores</dfn>,
who pack it, on asses, usually in large jars, from the spring.</p>

<p>This is the first Northern city in which there is to be
found any evidence of that variety of tropical fruits, for which
Southern Mexico is so justly famed. Although it was rather
out of season, yet the market actually teemed with all that
is most rich and exquisite in this kind of produce. The
<dfn>maguey</dfn>, from which is extracted the popular beverage called
<dfn>pulque</dfn>,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> is not only cultivated extensively in the fields, but
grows wild everywhere upon the plains. This being the
height of the pulque season, a hundred shanties might be
seen loaded with jugs and goblets filled with this favorite
liquor, from its sweetest unfermented state to the grade of
'hard cider;' while the incessant cries of "Pulque! pulque
dulce! pulque bueno!" added to the shrill and discordant
notes of the fruit venders, created a confusion of {89} sounds
amidst which it was impossible to hear oneself talk.</p>

<p>Durango is also celebrated as being the head-quarters,
as it were, of the whole scorpion family. During the spring,
especially, so much are the houses infested by these poisonous
insects, that many people are obliged to have resort to a
kind of mosquito-bar, in order to keep them out of their
beds at night. As an expedient to deliver the city from
this terrible pest, a society has actually been formed, which
pays a reward of a <dfn>cuartilla</dfn> (three cents) for every <dfn>alacran</dfn>
(or scorpion) that is brought to them. Stimulated by the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg166"></a>[p166]</span>
desire of gain, the idle boys of the city are always on the
look-out: so that, in the course of a year, immense numbers
of this public enemy are captured and slaughtered. The
body of this insect is of the bulk and cast of a medium spider,
with a jointed tail one to two inches long, at the end of which
is a sting whose wounds are so poisonous as often to prove
fatal to children, and are very painful to adults.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary peculiarity of these scorpions is,
that they are far less dangerous in the North than in the
South, which in some manner accounts for the story told
Capt. Pike, that even those of Durango lose most of their
venom as soon as they are removed a few miles from the
city.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Although we were exceedingly well armed, yet so many
fearful stories of robberies said to be committed, almost
daily, on the Southern roads, reached my ears, that before
{90} leaving Durango, I resolved to add to my 'weapons of
defence' one of those peculiarly terrible dogs which are sometimes
to be found in this country, and which are very serviceable
to travellers situated as I was. Having made my
wishes known to a free negro from the United States, named
George, he recommended me to a custom-house officer, and
a very particular friend of his, as being possessed of the very
article I was in search of. I accordingly called at the house
of that functionary, in company with my sable informant,
and we were ushered into a handsome parlor, where two or
three well-dressed señoritas sat discussing some of the
fruitful topics of the day. One of them—the officer's wife,
as it appeared, and a very comely dame she was—rose immediately,
and, with a great deal of ceremonious deference,
saluted <i>Señor Don Jorge</i>, inviting him at the same time to a <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg167"></a>[p167]</span>
seat, while I was left to remain perfectly unnoticed in my
standing position. George appeared considerably embarrassed,
for he had not quite forgotten the customs and manners
of his native country, and was even yet in the habit of
treating Americans not only with respect but with humility.
He therefore declined the tendered distinction, and remarked
that '<i>el señor</i>' had only come to purchase their dog. Upon
this, the lady pointed to a kennel in a corner, when the very
first glimpse of the ferocious animal convinced me that he
was precisely the sort of a customer I wanted for a companion.
Having therefore paid {91} down six dollars, the
stipulated sum of purchase, I bowed myself out of the
presence of the ladies, not a little impressed with my own
insignificance, in the eyes of these fair <i>doñas</i>, contrasted
with the grandeur of my sable companion. But the popularity
of negroes in Northern Mexico has ceased to be a
matter of surprise to the traveller.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>Don Jorge</i>, if I was surprised at the marks
of attention paid him by a white lady, I had cause to be
much more astonished shortly after. As the sooty don was
lounging about my wagons, a clever-visaged youth approached
and placed in his hands a satin stock, with the
compliments of his sister (the officer's wife), hoping that he
would accept that trifle, wrought by her own hand, as a
token of her particular regard! But, notwithstanding these
marks of distinction (to apply no harsher epithet), George
was exceedingly anxious to engage in my employ, in whatsoever
capacity I might choose to take him; for he had
discovered that such honors were far from affording him a
livelihood: yet I did not then need his services, and have
never heard of him since.</p>

<p>On the 22d we left Durango, and after a few days' march
found ourselves once more in the <i>camino real</i> that led from
Chihuahua to Zacatecas. All the frightful stories I had <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg168"></a>[p168]</span>
heard about robbers now began to flash upon my memory,
which made me regard every man I encountered on the road
with a very suspicious eye. As all travellers go armed, it
{92} is impossible to distinguish them from banditti;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> so
that the unsuspecting traveller is very frequently set upon
by the very man he had been consorting with in apparent
good-fellowship, and either murdered on the spot, or dragged
from his horse with the lazo, and plundered of all that is
valuable about him.</p>

<p>I have heard it asserted that there is a regular bandit
trade organized throughout the country, in which some of
the principal officers of state (and particularly of the judicial
corps) are not unfrequently engaged. A capital is made up
by shares, as for any other enterprise, bandits are fitted out
and instructed where to operate, and at stated periods of the
year a regular dividend is paid to the stockholders. The
impunity which these 'gentlemen of the order' almost everywhere
enjoy in the country, is therefore not to be marvelled
at. In Durango, during my sojourn there, a well dressed
caballero was frequently in the habit of entering our <i>meson</i>,
whom mine host soon pointed out to me as a notorious
brigand. "Beware of him," said the honest publican; "he
is prying into your affairs"—and so it turned out; for my
muleteer informed me that the fellow had been trying to
pump from him all the particulars in regard to our condition
and destination. Yet this worthy was not only suffered to
prowl about unmolested {93} by the authorities, but appeared
to be on familiar terms with many of the principal dignitaries
of the city. Notwithstanding all our apprehensions, however,
we arrived at our place of destination without even
the novelty of an incident to swell our budget of gossip.
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg169"></a>[p169]</span></p>

<p> The city of Aguascalientes is beautifully situated in a level
plain, and would appear to contain about twenty thousand
inhabitants, who are principally engaged in the manufacture
of <i>rebozos</i> and other textures mostly of cotton.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> As soon
as I found myself sufficiently at leisure, I visited the famous
warm spring (<i>ojo caliente</i>) in the suburbs, from which the
city derives its euphonious name. I followed up the <i>acequia</i>
that led from the spring—a ditch four or five feet wide,
through which flowed a stream three or four feet in depth.
The water was precisely of that agreeable temperature to
afford the luxury of a good bath, which I had hoped to enjoy;
but every few paces I found men, women, and children, submerged
in the acequia; and when I arrived at the basin, it
was so choked up with girls and full-grown women, who
were paddling about with all the nonchalance of a gang of
ducks, that I was forced to relinquish my long-promised
treat.</p>

<p>It had been originally my intention to continue on to
Leon, another manufacturing town some seventy or eighty
miles from Aguascalientes; but, hearing that Santa Anna
had just arrived there with a large army, on his way to
Zacatecas to quell an insurrection,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> I {94} felt very little
curiosity to extend my rambles further. Having, therefore,
made all my purchases in the shortest possible time, in a
few days I was again in readiness to start for the North.</p>

<p>That my mules might be in condition for the hard travel
before me, it was necessary to have them shod: a precaution,
however, which is seldom used in the north of Mexico, either <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg170"></a>[p170]</span>
with mules or horses. Owing a little to the peculiar breed,
but more still no doubt to the dryness of the climate, Mexican
animals have unusually hard hoofs. Many will travel for
weeks, and even months, over the firm<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and often rocky
roads of the interior (the pack-mules carrying their huge
loads), without any protection whatever to the feet, save
that which nature has provided. But most of mine being a
little tender-footed, I engaged Mexican <dfn>herreros</dfn> to fit them
out in their own peculiar style. Like almost everything
else of their manufacturing, their mule-shoes are of a rather
primitive model—broad thin plates, tacked on with large
club-headed nails. But the expertness of the shoers compensated
in some degree for the defects of the <i>herraduras</i>.
It made but little odds how wild and vicious the mule—an
assistant would draw up his foot in an instant, and soon
place him <i>hors de combat</i>; and then fixing a nail, the shoer
{95} would drive it to the head at a single stroke, standing
usually at full arm's length, while the assistant held the foot.
Thus in less than half the time I had ever witnessed the execution
of a similar job before, they had completely shod more
than twenty of the most unruly brutes—without once
resorting to the expedient so usual in such cases, of throwing
the animals upon the ground.</p>

<p>Just as the process of shoeing my mules had been completed,
a person who proved to be a public officer entered
the <i>corral</i>, and pointing to the mules, very politely informed
me that they were wanted by the government to transport
troops to Zacatecas. "They will be called for to-morrow
afternoon," he continued; "let them not be removed!" I
had of course to bow acquiescence to this imperative edict,
well knowing that all remonstrance would be vain; yet fully <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg171"></a>[p171]</span>
determined to be a considerable distance on the road northward
before that 'morrow' should be very far advanced.</p>

<p>But a new difficulty now presented itself. I must procure
a <dfn>guia</dfn> or passport for my cargo of merchandise, with a
<i>responsible endorser</i>,—an additional imposition I was wholly
unprepared for, as I was then ignorant of any law to that
effect being in force, and had not a single acquaintance in
the city. I was utterly at a loss what to do: under any other
circumstances I might have left the amount of the <i>derecho
de consumo</i> in deposit, as others have been obliged to do on
similar occasions; but {96} unfortunately I had laid out the
last dollar of my available means.</p>

<p>As I left the custom-house brooding over these perplexities,
one of the principal clerks of the establishment slipped a
piece of paper into my hand containing the following laconic
notice:—"<dfn>Aguárdeme afuera</dfn>" (wait for me without);—an
injunction I passively obeyed, although I had not the least
idea of its purport. The clerk was soon with me, and
remarked, "You are a stranger in the city, and ignorant of
our severe revenue laws: meet me in an hour from this at
my lodgings, and we will devise some remedy for your
difficulties." It may be well supposed that I did not fail to
be punctual. I met the obliging officer in his room with a
handful of blank custom-house <i>pases</i>. It should be understood
that a <dfn>pase</dfn> only differs from a <i>guia</i> in requiring no
endorser, but the former can only be extended for amounts
of goods not exceeding fifty dollars. Taking my bill, he
very soon filled me up a <i>pase</i> for every package, directing
each to a different point in the North. "Now," observed
my amiable friend, "if you are disposed to do a little smuggling,
these will secure your safety, if you avoid the principal
cities, till you reach the borders of Chihuahua: if not, you
may have a friend on the way who will endorse your <i>guia</i>."
I preferred the latter alternative. I had formed an acquaintance <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg172"></a>[p172]</span>
with a worthy German merchant in Durango, who, I
felt convinced, would generously lend his signature to the
required document.</p>

<p>{97} As the revenue officers of Northern Mexico are not
celebrated for liberality and disinterestedness, I took it for
granted that my friend of the custom-house was actuated
by selfish motives, and therefore proffered him a remuneration
for the trouble he had taken on my account; but to my
surprise, he positively refused accepting anything, observing
that he held it the duty of every honest man to assist his
fellow creatures in case of difficulty. It is truly a pleasant
task to bear record of such instances of disinterestedness, in
the midst of so many contaminating influences.</p>

<p>While speaking of <i>guias</i>, I may as well remark that they
are also frequently required for specie and always for bullion.
This is often very annoying to the traveller, not only because
it is sometimes inconvenient to find an endorser, but because
the robbers are thus enabled to obtain precise and timely
information of the funds and route of every traveller; for
they generally have their agents in all the principal cities,
who are apt to collude with some of the custom-house clerks,
and thus procure regular reports of the departures, with the
amounts of valuables conveyed.</p>

<p>I was not long in taking leave of Aguascalientes, and
heard nothing more of the impressment of my mules. It
was not my good fortune, however, to remain for any length
of time out of trouble. Being anxious to take the city of
Zacatecas in my route without jeopardizing my goods, I
took passage by the <i>diligencia</i>, while my wagons continued
on in {98} the <dfn>camino real</dfn> or main road. On my arrival at
Zacatecas, I very soon discovered that by leaving 'my bed
and board' behind with the wagons, I had doomed myself
to no small inconvenience and privation. It was with the
greatest difficulty I could obtain a place to lie upon, and <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg173"></a>[p173]</span>
clean victuals with which to allay my hunger. I could get
a room, it is true, even for a <i>real</i> per day, in one of those
great barn-like <i>mesones</i> which are to be met with in all these
cities, but not one of them was at all furnished. There is
sometimes, in a corner, a raised platform of mud, much
resembling a common blacksmith's hearth, which is to supply
the place of a bedstead, upon which the traveller may
spread his blankets, if he happen to have any. On this
occasion I succeeded in borrowing one or two of the stage-driver
who was a Yankee, and so made out 'pretty comfortably'
in the sleeping way. These <i>mesones</i> are equally
ill-prepared to furnish food for the traveller, unless he is
willing to put up with a dish of <i>frijoles</i> and <i>chile guisado</i> with
<i>tortillas</i>, all served up in the most filthy manner. I therefore
sought out a public <i>fonda</i> kept by an Italian, where I procured
an excellent supper. Fondas, however, are mere
<i>restaurants</i>, and consequently without accommodations for
lodging.</p>

<p>Strange as the fact may appear, one may travel fifteen
hundred miles, and perhaps more, on the main public highway
through Northern Mexico, without finding a single
tavern with general accommodations. This, however, may
{99} be accounted for, by taking into consideration the
peculiar mode of travelling of the country, which renders
resorts of this kind almost unnecessary. <i>Arrieros</i> with
their <i>atajos</i> of pack-mules always camp out, being provided
with their cooks and stock of provisions, which they
carry with them. Ordinary travellers generally unite in
little caravans, for security against robbers and marauders;
and no caballero ever stirs abroad without a train of servants,
and a pack-mule to carry his <dfn>cantinas</dfn> (a pair of large wallets
or leathern boxes), filled with provisions, on the top of which
is lashed a huge machine containing a mattress and all the
other 'fixings' for bed furniture. Thus equipped, the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg174"></a>[p174]</span>
caballero snaps his fingers at all the <i>hotels garnis</i> of the
universe, and is perfectly independent in every movement.</p>

<p>The city of Zacatecas, as my readers are doubtless aware,
is celebrated for its mining interests. Like all other Mexican
towns of the same class, it originated in small, insignificant
settlements on the hillsides, in the immediate vicinity of the
mines, until it gradually grew up to be a large and wealthy
city, with a population of some 30,000 inhabitants. Its
locale is a deep ravine formed among rugged mountain
ridges; and as the houses are mostly built in rows, overtopping
one another, along the hillsides, some portions of the
city present all the appearance of a vast amphitheatre.
Many of the streets are handsomely paved, and two of the
squares are finely ornamented with curiously carved <i>jets-d'eau</i>,
{100} which are supplied with water raised by mule
power, from wells among the adjacent hills. From these
the city is chiefly furnished with water.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned, that General Santa Anna was
at this time marching against Zacatecas with a large force.
It may be remembered that after the General's accession to
the supreme authority of Mexico (upon the establishment of
<i>Centralismo</i>), he deemed it expedient to issue a decree abolishing
the state militia, known as <dfn>Cívicos</dfn>, as being dangerous
to the liberties of——the <i>dictador</i>. Zacatecas, so far from
obeying this despotic mandate, publicly called on the
Cívicos to defend their rights, and Santa Anna was now
descending upon them with an army double that which the
city could raise, to enforce their obedience. The <i>Zacatecanos</i>,
however, were not idle. The militia was pouring in from
the surrounding villages, and a degree of enthusiasm prevailed
throughout the city, which seemed to be the presage
of a successful defence. In fact, the city itself, besides being
from its location almost impregnable, was completely protected
by artificial fortifications. The only accessible point <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg175"></a>[p175]</span>
was by the main road, which led from the south immediately
up the narrow valley of the ravine. Across this a strong
wall had been erected some years before, and the road passed
through a large gate, commanded by a bastion upon the
hillside above, whence a hundred men well supplied with
arms and ammunition, might easily cut {101} off thousands
upon thousands, as fast as they advanced. The city was
therefore deemed impregnable, and being supplied with provisions
for a lengthy siege, the patriots were in high spirits.
A foreign engineer or two had been engaged to superintend
the fortifications.</p>

<p>Santa Anna reached Zacatecas a few days after my departure.
As he had no idea of testing the doubtful mettle of
his army, by an attempt to storm the place, which presented
so formidable an appearance, he very quietly squatted himself
down at the village of Guadalupe, three miles below.
From this point he commenced his operations by throwing
'missiles' into the city—not of lead, or cast-iron, or any
such cruel agents of warfare, but <i>bombs of paper</i>, which fell
among the besieged, and burst with gentle overtures to their
commanding officers. This novel 'artillery' of the dictator
produced a perfectly electric effect; for the valor of the
commandant of the Cívicos rose to such a pitch, that he at
once marched his forces out of the fortifications, to attack
the besiegers in the open field—face to face, as true bravery
required. But on the very first onset, this valiant officer,
by some mysterious agency which could not be accounted
for, was suddenly seized with a strange panic, and, with all
his forces, made a precipitate retreat, fleeing helter-skelter,
as if all the engines of destruction that were ever invented,
had been brought to bear upon them; when the victorious
army of Santa Anna marched into the city without further
opposition.</p>

<p>{102} This affair is a pretty just sample of most of the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg176"></a>[p176]</span>
successful battles of this 'great general.' The treacherous
collusion of the principal Zacatecas officers was so apparent,
that they deemed it prudent to fly the city for safety, lest
the wrath of their incensed fellow-citizens should explode
upon them. Meanwhile the soldiery amused themselves by
sacking the city, and by perpetrating every species of outrage
that their mercenary and licentious appetites could
devise. Their savage propensities were particularly exercised
against the few foreigners that were found in the place.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was journeying very leisurely towards
Durango, where I arrived on the 21st of April. As the main
wagon road to the north does not pass through that city, it
was most convenient and still more prudent for me to leave
my wagons at a distance: their entrance would have occasioned
the confiscation of my goods, for the want of the
'necessary documents,' as already alluded to. But I now
procured a <i>guia</i> without further difficulty; which was indeed
a principal object of my present visit to that city.</p>

<p>Before leaving Durango I witnessed one of those civil
broils which are so common in Mexico. I was not even
aware that any difficulty had been brewing, till I was waked
on the morning of the 25th by a report of fire-arms. Stepping
out to ascertain what was the matter, I perceived the
<i>azotea</i> of the parochial church occupied by armed men, who
seemed to be employed in amusing themselves {103} by
discharging their guns at random upon the people in the
streets. These <i>bravos</i>, as I was afterwards informed, belonged
to the bishop's party, or that of the <i>Escoceses</i>, which
was openly at war with the liberalists, anti-hierarchists, or
<i>Yorkinos</i>, and were resorting to this summary mode of proceeding,
in order to bring about a change of affairs; for at
this time the liberal party had the ascendency in the civil
government of Durango. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg177"></a>[p177]</span></p>

<p>Being somewhat curious to have a nearer view of what
was going on, I walked down past the church, towards a
crowd which was assembled in a <i>plaza</i> beyond. This movement
on my part was rather inconsiderate: for foreigners
were in extremely bad odor with the belligerents; nor had I
mingled with the multitude many minutes, before a sober-looking
citizen plucked me by the sleeve, and advised me, if
I valued my two ears, and did not wish to have my career of
usefulness cut short prematurely, to stay within doors. Of
course I needed no further persuasion, and returned at once
to my lodgings, where I made immediate preparations for a
speedy departure. As I was proceeding through the streets
soon afterward, with a cargo of goods, I received, just after
leaving the custom-house, a very warm salutation from the
belligerents, which made the dust start from almost under
my very feet. The <i>cargadores</i> who were carrying my packages
were no doubt as much frightened as myself. They
supposed the reason of their shooting at us to be because {104}
they imagined we were carrying off the <dfn>parque</dfn> (ammunition)
of the government, which was deposited in the building we
had just left.</p>

<p>We were soon under way, and very little regret did I feel
when I fairly lost sight of the city of scorpions. But I was
not yet wholly beyond the pale of difficulties. Owing to
the fame of the Indian hostilities in the North, it was almost
impossible to procure the services of Mexican muleteers for
the expedition. One I engaged, took the first convenient
opportunity to escape at night, carrying away a gun with
which I had armed him; yet I felt grateful that he did not also
take a mule, as he had the whole <i>caballada</i> under his exclusive
charge: and soon after, a Mexican wagoner was frightened
back by the reports of savages.</p>

<p>After a succession of such difficulties, and still greater <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg178"></a>[p178]</span>
risks from the Indians that infested the route, I was of
course delighted when I reached Chihuahua, on the 14th of
May, in perfect safety.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Before resuming my regular narrative, I trust the reader
will pardon me for introducing here a brief account of an
excursion which I made in the fall of the year 1835, to the
mining town of Jesus-Maria, one of the most important
mineral districts in the department of Chihuahua, situated
about a hundred and fifty miles west of the city, in the very
heart of the great Cordilleras.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>I had long been desirous of visiting some of the mining
establishments of Mexico, and seeing a favorable opportunity
of embarking in a profitable enterprise, I set out from Chihuahua
on the 15th of October. My party consisted of but
one American comrade, with {106} a Mexican muleteer—and
three or four mules freighted with specie to be employed
in the <i>silver trade</i>: a rather scanty convoy for a route subject
to the inroads both of savages and robbers. For transportation, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg179"></a>[p179]</span>
we generally pack our specie in sacks made of raw
beef hide, which shrinks upon drying, and thus presses the
contents so closely as to prevent friction. A pair of these
packages, usually containing between one and two thousand
dollars each, constitutes an ordinary mule-load on the mountain
routes.</p>

<p>The road in this direction leads through the roughest
mountain passes; and, in some places, it winds so close along
the borders of precipices, that by a single misstep an animal
might be precipitated several hundred feet. Mules, however,
are very surefooted; and will often clamber along the
most craggy cliffs with nearly as much security as the goat.
I was shown the projecting edge of a rock over which the
road had formerly passed. This shelf was perhaps thirty feet
in length by only two or three in width. The road which leads
into the town of Jesus-Maria from the west side of the mountain
is also extremely perilous and steep, and seems almost
to overhang the houses below. Heavily laden mules have
sometimes slipped off the track, and tumbled headlong into
the town. This place is even more pent up between ridges
than Zacatecas: the valley is narrower and the mountains
much higher; while, as is the case with that remarkable city,
the houses are {107} sometimes built in successive tiers, one
above another; the <i>azoteas</i> of the lower ones forming the
yard of those above.</p>

<p>The first mine I visited consisted of an immense horizontal
shaft cut several hundred feet into a hill-side, a short distance
below the town of Jesus-Maria, upon which the proprietors
had already sunk, in the brief space of one year,
the enormous sum of one hundred and twenty thousand
dollars! Such is often the fate of the speculative miner,
whose vocation is closely allied to gaming, and equally precarious. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg180"></a>[p180]</span></p>

<p>The most important mine of Jesus-Maria at this time was
one called Santa Juliana, which had been the means of
alternately making and sinking several splendid fortunes.
This mine had then reached a depth of between eight and
nine hundred feet, and the operations were still tending
downwards. The materials were drawn up by mule power
applied to a windlass: but as the rope attached to it only
extended half way down, another windlass had been erected
at the distance of about four hundred feet from the mouth of
the cavern, which was also worked by mules, and drew the
ores, etc., from the bottom. On one occasion, as I was
standing near the aperture of this great pit, watching the
ascent of the windlass-rope, expecting every moment the
appearance of the large leathern bucket which they employ
for drawing up the minerals as well as the rubbish and
water<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> from the bottom, {108} what should greet my vision
but a mule, puffing and writhing, firmly bound to a huge
board constructed for the purpose, and looking about as
demure upon the whole as a sheep under the shears. On
being untied, the emancipated brute suddenly sprang to
his feet, and looked around him at the bright scenes of
the upper world with as much astonishment as Rip Van
Winkle may be supposed to have felt after waking up from
his twenty years' sleep.</p>

<p>The ore which is obtained from these mines, if sufficiently
rich to justify the operation, is transferred to the smelting
furnaces, where the pure metal is melted down and extracted
from the virgin fossil. If, on the contrary, the ore is deemed
of inferior quality, it is then submitted to the process of
amalgamation.</p>

<p>{109} The <dfn>moliendas</dfn>, or crushing-mills (<dfn>arrastres</dfn>, as called
at some mines), employed for the purpose of grinding the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg183"></a>[p183]</span>
ores, are somewhat singular machines. A circular (or
rather annular) cistern of some twenty or thirty feet in
diameter is dug in the earth, and the sides as well as the
bottom are lined with hewn stone of the hardest quality.
Transversely through an upright post which turns upon
its axis in the centre of the plan, passes a shaft of wood, at
each end of which are attached by cords one or two grinding-stones
with smooth flat surfaces, which are dragged (by
mules fastened to the extremities of the shaft) slowly around
upon the bottom of the cistern, into which the ore is thrown
after being pounded into small pieces. It is here ground,
with the addition of water, into an impalpable mortar, by
the constant friction of the dragging stones against the sides
and bottom of the cistern. A suitable quantity of quicksilver
is perfectly mixed with the mortar; to which are added
some muriates, sulphates, and other chemical substances, to
facilitate the amalgamation. The compound is then piled
up in small heaps, and not disturbed again until this process
is supposed to be complete, when it is transferred to the
washing-machine. Those I have observed are very simple,
consisting of a kind of stone tub, into which a stream of
water is made to flow constantly, so as to carry off all the
lighter matter, which is kept stirred up by an upright studded
with pegs, that revolves in the centre, while the amalgamated
metals sink {110} to the bottom. Most of the quicksilver is
then pressed out, and the silver submitted to a burning
process, by which the remaining portion of mercury is
expelled.</p>

<p>The silver which is taken from the furnace, generally contains
an intermixture of gold, averaging from ten to thirty
per cent.; but what is extracted by amalgamation is mostly
separated in the washing. While in a liquid state, the gold,
from its greater specific gravity, mostly settles to the bottom:
yet it usually retains a considerable alloy of silver. The <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg184"></a>[p184]</span>
compound is distinguished by the name of <dfn>oroche</dfn>. The
main portion of the silver generally retains too little gold to
make it worth separating.</p>

<p>Every species of silver is moulded into <dfn>barras</dfn> or ingots,
weighing from fifty to eighty pounds each, and usually
worth between one and two thousand dollars. These are
assayed by an authorized agent of the government, and
stamped with their weight and character, which enables the
holder to calculate their value by a very simple rule. When
the bullion is thus stamped, it constitutes a species of currency,
which is much safer for remittances than coin. In
case of robbery, the <i>barras</i> are easily identified, provided
the robbers have not had time to mould them into some other
form. For this reason, people of wealth frequently lay up
their funds in ingots; and the cellars of some of the <i>ricos</i> of
the South, are often found teeming with large quantities of
them, presenting the appearance of a winter's supply of
firewood.</p>

<p>{111} As the charge for parting the gold and silver at the
Mexican mints, is generally from one to two dollars, and
coinage about fifty cents, per pound, this assayed bullion
yields a profit upon its current value of nearly ten per cent.
at the United States Mint; but, if unassayed, it generally
produces an advance of about double that amount upon the
usual cost at the mines. The exportation of bullion, however,
is prohibited, except by special license from the general
government. Still a large quantity is exported in this way,
and considerable amounts smuggled out through some of
the ports.</p>

<p>A constant and often profitable business in the 'silver
trade' is carried on at these mines. As the miners rarely
fail being in need of ready money, they are generally obliged
to sell their bullion for coin, and that often at a great sacrifice,
so as to procure available means to prosecute their mining <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg185"></a>[p185]</span>
operations. To profit by this trade, as is already mentioned,
was a principal object of my present visit. Having concluded
my business transactions, and partially gratified my
curiosity, I returned to Chihuahua, where I arrived, November
24, 1835, without being molested either by robbers or
Indians, though the route is sometimes infested by both
these classes of independent gentry.</p>

<p>But, as it is now high time I should put an end to this
digression, I will once more resume my narrative, where it
was interrupted at my arrival in Chihuahua, on the first of
October, 1839.</p>

<p>{112} It is usual for each trader, upon his arrival in that
city, to engage a store-room, and to open and exhibit his
goods, as well for the purpose of disposing of them at wholesale
as retail. His most profitable custom is that of the
petty country merchants from the surrounding villages.
Some traders, it is true, continue in the retail business for a
season or more, yet the greater portion are transient dealers,
selling off at wholesale as soon as a fair bargain is offered.</p>

<p>The usual mode of selling by the lot in Chihuahua is somewhat
singular. All such cottons as calicoes and other
prints, bleached, brown and blue domestics both plain and
twilled, stripes, checks, etc., are rated at two or three <i>reales</i><a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
per <i>vara</i>, without the least reference to quality or cost, and
the 'general assortment' at 60 to 100 per cent. upon the
bills of cost, according to the demand. The <i>varage</i> is <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg186"></a>[p186]</span>
usually estimated by adding eight per cent. to the yardage, but
the <i>vara</i> being thirty-three inches (nearly), the actual difference
is more than nine. In these sales, cloths—{113} indeed
all measurable goods, except ribands and the like, sometimes
enter at the <i>varage</i> rate. I have heard of some still
more curious contracts in these measurement sales, particularly
in Santa Fé, during the early periods of the American
trade. Everything was sometimes rated by the vara—not
only all textures, but even hats, cutlery, trinkets, and so on!
In such cases, very singular disputes would frequently arise
as to the mode of measuring some particular articles: for
instance, whether pieces of riband should be measured in
bulk, or unrolled, and yard by yard; looking-glasses, cross or
lengthwise; pocket-knives, shut or open; writing-paper, in
the ream, in the quire, or by the single sheet; and then,
whether the longer or shorter way of the paper; and so of
many others.</p>

<p>Before the end of October, 1839, I had an opportunity of
selling out my stock of goods to a couple of English merchants,
which relieved me from the delays, to say nothing of
the inconveniences attending a retail trade: such, for
instance, as the accumulation of copper coin, which forms
almost the exclusive currency in petty dealings. Some
thousands of dollars' worth are frequently accumulated upon
the hands of the merchant in this way, and as the copper of
one department is worthless in another, except for its intrinsic
value, which is seldom more than ten per cent. of
the nominal value, the holders are subjected to a great deal
of trouble and annoyance.</p>

<p>With regard to the city, there is but little to {114} be said
that is either very new or unusually interesting. When
compared with Santa Fé and all the towns of the North,
Chihuahua might indeed be pronounced a magnificent place;
but, compared with the nobler cities of <i>tierra afuera</i>, it sinks <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg187"></a>[p187]</span>
into insignificance. According to Capt. Pike, the city of
Chihuahua was founded in 1691. The ground-plan is much
more regular than that of Santa Fé, while a much greater
degree of elegance and classic taste has been exhibited in
the style of the architecture of many buildings; for though
the bodies be of <i>adobe</i>, all the best houses are cornered with
hewn stone, and the doors and windows are framed in the
same. The streets, however, remain nearly in the same
state as Nature formed them, with the exception of a few
roughly-paved side-walks. Although situated about a hundred
miles east of the main chain of the Mexican Cordilleras,
Chihuahua is surrounded on every side by detached ridges
of mountains, but none of them of any great magnitude.
The elevation of the city above the ocean is between four
and five thousand feet; its latitude is <span class="fraction">28° 36′;</span> and its entire
population numbers about ten thousand souls.</p>

<p>The most splendid edifice in Chihuahua is the principal
church, which is said to equal in architectural grandeur anything
of the sort in the republic. The steeples, of which there
is one at each front corner, rise over a hundred feet above
the azotea. They are composed of very fancifully-carved
columns; and {115} in appropriate niches of the frontispiece,
which is also an elaborate piece of sculpture, are to be seen
a number of statues, as large as life, the whole forming a
complete representation of Christ and the twelve Apostles.
This church was built about a century ago, by contributions
levied upon the mines (particularly those of Santa Eulalia,
fifteen or twenty miles from the city), which paid over a
per centage on all the metal extracted therefrom; a <i>medio</i>,
I believe, being levied upon each <i>marco</i> of eight ounces. In
this way, about a million of dollars was raised and expended
in some thirty years, the time employed in the construction
of the building. It is a curious fact, however, that,
notwithstanding the enormous sums of money expended <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg188"></a>[p188]</span>
in outward embellishments, there is not a church from
thence southward, perhaps, where the interior arrangements
bear such striking marks of poverty and neglect. If,
however, we are not dazzled by the sight of those costly
decorations for which the churches of Southern Mexico
are so much celebrated, we have the satisfaction of knowing
that the turrets are well provided with bells, a fact of which
every person who visits Chihuahua very soon obtains auricular
demonstration. One, in particular, is so large and
sonorous that it has frequently been heard, so I am informed,
at the distance of twenty-five miles.</p>

<p>A little below the <i>Plaza Mayor</i> stands the ruins (as they
may be called) of San Francisco—the mere skeleton of
another great church {116} of hewn-stone, which was commenced
by the Jesuits previous to their expulsion in 1767,
but never finished. By the outlines still traceable amid the
desolation which reigns around, it would appear that the
plan of this edifice was conceived in a spirit of still greater
magnificence than the Parroquia which I have been describing.
The abounding architectural treasures that are mouldering
and ready to tumble to the ground, bear sufficient evidence
that the mind which had directed its progress was at
once bold, vigorous and comprehensive.</p>

<p>This dilapidated building has since been converted into
a sort of state prison, particularly for the incarceration of
distinguished prisoners. It was here that the principals of
the famous Texan Santa Fé Expedition were confined, when
they passed through the place, on their way to the city of
Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> This edifice has also acquired considerable
celebrity as having received within its gloomy embraces
several of the most distinguished patriots, who were taken
prisoners during the first infant struggles for Mexican independence. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg189"></a>[p189]</span>
Among these was the illustrious ecclesiastic,
Don Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who made the first declaration
at the village of Dolores, September 16, 1810.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> He
was taken prisoner in March, 1811, some time after his total
defeat at Guadalaxara; and being brought to Chihuahua,
he was shot on the 30th of July following, in a little square
back of the prison, where a plain white monument of hewn
stone {117} has been erected to his memory. It consists of
an octagon base of about twenty-five feet in diameter, upon
which rises a square, unornamented pyramid to the height
of about thirty feet. The monument indeed is not an unapt
emblem of the purity and simplicity of the curate's character.</p>

<p>Among the few remarkable objects which attract the
attention of the traveller is a row of columns supporting a
large number of stupendous arches which may be seen from
the heights, long before approaching the city from the north.
This is an aqueduct of considerable magnitude which conveys
water from the little river of Chihuahua, to an eminence
above the town, whence it is passed through a succession of
pipes to the main public square, where it empties itself into
a large stone cistern; and by this method the city is supplied
with water. This and other public works to be met with in
Chihuahua, and in the southern cities, are glorious remnants
of the prosperous times of the Spanish empire. No improvements
on so exalted a scale have ever been made under
the republican government. In fact, everything in this benighted
country now seems to be on the decline, and the
plain honest citizen of the old school is not unfrequently
heard giving vent to his feelings by ejaculating "<dfn>¡Ojalá por
los dias felices del Rey!</dfn>"—Oh, for the happy days of the
King! In short, there can be no doubt, that the common
people enjoyed more ease—more protection against the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg190"></a>[p190]</span>
savages—more {118} security in their rights and property—more
<i>liberty</i>, in truth, under the Spanish dynasty than at
present.</p>

<p>No better evidence can be found of the extensive operations
which have been carried on in this the greatest mining
district of Northern Mexico, than in the little mountains of
<i>scoria</i> which are found in the suburbs of the city. A great
number of poor laborers make a regular business of hammering
to pieces these metallic excrescences, from which they
collect silver enough to buy their daily bread. An opinion
has often been expressed by persons well acquainted with
the subject, that a fair business might be done by working
this same scoria over again. There are still in operation
several furnaces in the city, where silver ores extracted from
the mines of the surrounding mountains are smelted. There
is also a rough mint in Chihuahua (as there is indeed in all
the mining departments), yet most of its silver and all of its
gold have been coined in the cities further south.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Chihuahua, in 1839, a great fête had
just come off for the double purpose of celebrating the anniversary
of the Emperor Iturbide's birth day (Sept. 27, 1783),
and that of his triumphal entrance into the city of Mexico
in 1821. It will be remembered, that, after Mexico had
been struggling for independence several years, General
Iturbide, who had remained a faithful officer of the crown,
and an active agent in persecuting the champions of Mexican
liberty, finding {119} himself, about the close of 1820, at the
head of a large division of the royal army sent against the
patriot Guerrero, suddenly turned over his whole force to
the support of the republican cause, and finally succeeded
in destroying the last vestige of Spanish authority in Mexico.
How he was afterwards crowned emperor, and subsequently <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg191"></a>[p191]</span>
dethroned, outlawed by a public decree and eventually
executed, is all matter of history.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> But it is not generally
known, I believe, that this unfortunate soldier has since received
the honors of the Father of the Republic, a dignity
to which he was probably as much entitled as any one else—absurd
though the adoption of such a hero as the 'champion
of liberty,' may appear to 'republicans of the Jefferson
school.' A <i>grande fête d'hilarité</i> takes place annually, in
honor of his political canonization, which 'comes off' at the
date already mentioned. To this great ball, however, no
Americans were invited, with the exception of a Mexicanized
denizen or two, whose invitation tickets informed the <i>honored
party</i> that the price of admission to this famous feast,—a
ball given by the governor and other magnates of the land,
in honor of the hero of independence,—was twenty-five
dollars.</p>

<p>Balls or reunions of this kind, however, seem not as
frequent in Chihuahua as in New Mexico: and to those
we hear of, claiming the title of 'fashionable,' Americans
are very rarely invited. There is, in fact, but little social
intercourse between foreigners and the natives, {120} except
in a business way, or with a certain class of the former,
at the gambling-table. This want of hospitable feelings
is one of the worst traits in the character of the Chihuahueños,
and when placed in contrast with the kind and
courteous treatment those who visit the United States invariably
experience from the lawgivers of fashion among
us, their illiberality will appear a hundred fold more
ungracious. These exclusive laws are the more severely
felt in Chihuahua, because in that city there are no <i>cafés</i>, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg192"></a>[p192]</span>
nor reading rooms, nor in short any favorite public resorts,
except of a gambling character, at which gentlemen can
meet to lounge or amuse themselves.</p>

<p>Besides the cock-pit, the gaming-table, and the <dfn>Alameda</dfn>,
which is the popular promenade for the wealthy and the
indolent, one of the most favorite pastimes of the females
generally is shopping; and the most fashionable time for
this is by candle-light, after they have partaken of their
chocolate and their <i>cigarritos</i>. The streets and shops are
literally filled from dusk till nine or ten o'clock; and many
a time have I seen the counter of a store actually lined till
a late hour, with the fairest and most fashionable señoritas
of the city. On such occasions it is not a little painful
as well as troublesome to be compelled to keep a strict
eye to the rights of property, not that the dealers are all
dishonest, but because there never fail to be some present
who are painfully afflicted with the self-appropriating mania,
{121} even among the fairest-looking señoritas. This, with
other purposes no less culpable, has no doubt tended to
establish the custom of night-shopping.</p>

<p>It may already be generally known perhaps, that the
predominant party, in Mexico, (and particularly in the
North), is decidedly anti-masonic. During my stay in
Chihuahua I had an opportunity to test their antipathy
for that mysterious brotherhood. This was evinced in
the seizure of a dozen or two cotton handkerchiefs, which,
unknown to myself, happened to bear the stamp of the
'masonic carpet.' These obnoxious articles having attracted
the attention of some lynx-eyed friars, one day,
much to my consternation, my store was suddenly invaded
by the alcalde and some ecclesiastics. The handkerchiefs
were seized without ceremony, and by an <i>auto de fe</i>, condemned
to be publicly burned.</p>

class="toclnk">toc</a></p>

<p>Having closed all my affairs in Chihuahua, and completed
my preparations for departing, I took my leave of
that city for the North, on the 31st of October, 1839. I
was accompanied by a caravan consisting of twenty-two
wagons (all of which save one belonged to me), and forty
odd men, armed to the teeth, and prepared for any emergency
we might be destined to encounter: a precaution
altogether necessary, in view of the hordes of hostile savages
which at all times infested the route before us.</p>

<p>We also set out provided with an ample stock of bread
and other necessaries; for, from the suburbs of Chihuahua
to the village of {123} Carrizal, a distance of nearly a hundred
and fifty miles, there are no settlements on the route,
from whence to procure supplies. To furnish the party
with meat, I engaged twenty sheep, to be delivered a few
miles on the way, which were to be driven along for our
daily consumption. But the contractor having failed,
we found ourselves entering the wilderness without a morsel
of meat. The second day our men began to murmur—it
was surely 'dry living' upon mere bread and coffee: in
fact, by the time we entered the 'territory' of the Hacienda
de Encinillas, spoken of in another chapter, they were
clearly suffering from hunger. I was therefore under the
necessity of sending three Mexican muleteers of our party <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg194"></a>[p194]</span>
to <i>lazo</i> a beef from a herd which was grazing at some distance
from where we had pitched our camp; being one of
those buffalo-like droves which run so nearly wild upon
this extensive domain. It had been customary, from time
immemorial, for travellers when they happened to be distressed
for meat, to supply their wants out of the wild cattle
which nominally belonged to this hacienda, reserving to
themselves the privilege of paying a reasonable price afterwards
to the proprietor for the damage committed. I
must say, however, that, although I had travelled over
the same road nine times, I had never before resorted to
this summary mode of procuring food; nor should I, on the
present occasion, have deviated from my regular practice,
though thus partially authorized by a custom of the {124}
country, but for the strait in which we found ourselves,
and the fact that I was confident I should meet either
with a <i>mayordomo</i> or some of the <i>vaqueros</i>, to whom I could
pay the value of the beef, before passing beyond the purlieus
of the hacienda, upon the lands of which we had yet
to travel for sixty or eighty miles.</p>

<p>The muleteers had just commenced giving chase to the
cattle, when we perceived several horsemen emerge from
behind a contiguous eminence, and pursue them at full
speed. Believing the assailants to be Indians, and seeing
them shoot at one of the men, chase another, and seize
the third, bearing him off prisoner, several of us prepared
to hasten to the rescue, when the other two men came
running in and informed us that the aggressors were Mexican
vaqueros. We followed them, notwithstanding, to
the village of Torreon, five or six miles to the westward,
where we found a crowd of people already collected around
our poor friend, who was trembling from head to foot,
as though he had really fallen into the hands of savages.
I immediately inquired for the mayordomo, when I was <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg195"></a>[p195]</span>
informed that the proprietor himself, Don Angel Trias,
was present. Accordingly I addressed myself to <i>su señoría</i>,
setting forth the innocence of my servant, and declaring
myself solely responsible for whatever crime had been
committed. Trias, however, was immovable in his determination
to send the boy back to Chihuahua to be tried
for robbery, and all further expostulation only drew down
the {125} grossest and coarsest insults upon myself, as
well as my country, of which he professed no inconsiderable
knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>The altercation was at first conducted solely in Spanish;
but the princely señor growing weary of hearing so many
unpalatable truths told of himself in the vernacular of his
own humble and astounded menials, he stepped out from
among the crowd, and addressed me in English,—a language
in which he had acquired some proficiency in the
course of his travels. The change of language by no means
altered his views, nor abated his pertinacity. At last,
finding there was nothing to be gained by this war of words,
I ordered the boy to mount his horse and rejoin the wagons.
"Beware of the consequences!" vociferated the enraged
Trias. "Well, let them come," I replied; "here we are."
But we were suffered to depart in peace with the prisoner.</p>

<p>That the reader may be able to form some idea of the
pusillanimity of this lordly <i>haciendero</i>, it is only necessary
to add, that when the altercation took place we were inside
of the fortifications, from which our egress might easily
have been prevented by simply closing the outer gate. We <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg196"></a>[p196]</span>
were surrounded by the whole population of the village,
besides a {126} small detachment of regular troops, whose
commandant took a very active part in the controversy,
and fought most valiantly with his tongue. But the valor
of the illustrious Señor Don Angel knew a much safer
course than to vent itself where there was even a remote
chance of personal risk. His influence could not fail to
enlist the public in his behalf, and he thought no doubt
that his battles might just as well be fought by the officers
of justice as by himself.</p>

<p>Yet ignorant of his designs, and supposing the matter
would end at this, we continued our march the next day,
and by the time night approached we were full twenty
miles from the seat of our late troubles. While at breakfast
on the following morning we were greatly surprised
by the appearance of two American gentlemen direct from
Chihuahua, who had ridden thus far purposely to apprise
us of what was brewing in the city to our detriment. It
appeared that Trias had sent an express to the governor
accusing me of rescuing a culprit from the hands of justice
by force of arms, and that great preparations were accordingly
being made to overtake and carry me back. That
the reader may be able to understand the full extent and
enormity of my offence, he has only to be informed that
the proprietor of an hacienda is at once governor, justice
of the peace, and everything besides which he has a mind
to fancy himself—a perfect despot within the limits of
his little dominion. It was, therefore, through contempt
for <em>his</em> 'excellency' {127} that I had insulted the majesty
of the laws!</p>

<p>Having expressed my sentiments of gratitude to my worthy
countrymen for the pains they had taken on my account,
we again pursued our journey, determined to abide the
worst. This happened on the 3d of November: on the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg197"></a>[p197]</span>
5th we encamped near the Ojo Caliente, a hundred and
thirty miles from Chihuahua. About eleven o'clock at
night, a large body of men were seen approaching. They
very soon passed us, and quietly encamped at a distance
of several hundred yards. They were over a hundred in
number.</p>

<p>Nothing further occurred till next morning, when, just
as I had risen from my pallet, a soldier approached and
inquired if I was up. In a few minutes he returned with
a message from <i>El Señor Capitan</i> to know if he could see
me. Having answered in the affirmative, a very courteous
and agreeable personage soon made his appearance, who,
after bowing and scraping until I began to be seriously
afraid that his body would break in two, finally opened
his mission by handing me a packet of letters, one of which
contained an order from the Governor for my immediate
presence in Chihuahua, together with the three muleteers
whom I had sent after the cattle; warning me, at the same
time, not to give cause, by my resistance, for any other
measure, which might be unpleasant to my person. The
next document was from Señor Trias himself, in which
he expressed his regret {128} at having carried the matter
to such an extreme, and ended with the usual offer of his
services to facilitate an adjustment. Those, however,
which most influenced my course, were from Don José
Artalejo (<dfn>Juez de Hacienda</dfn>, Judge of the Customs, of
Chihuahua), who offered to become responsible for a
favorable issue if I would peaceably return; and another
from a Mr. Sutton, with whom I had formerly been connected
in business. The manly and upright deportment
of this gentleman had inspired me with the greatest confidence,
and therefore caused me to respect his opinions.
But, besides my obligation to submit to a mandate from
the government, however arbitrary and oppressive, another <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg198"></a>[p198]</span>
strong motive which induced me to return, in obedience
to the Governor's order, was a latent misgiving lest any
hostile movement on my part, no matter with what justice
or necessity, might jeopardize the interests if not the lives
of many of my countrymen in Chihuahua.</p>

<p>With regard to ourselves and our immediate safety, we
would have found but very little difficulty in fighting our
way out of the country. We were all well-armed, and
many appeared even anxious to have a brush with the
besiegers. However, I informed the captain that I was
willing to return to Chihuahua, with the three 'criminals,'
provided we were permitted to go armed and free, as I
was not aware of having committed any crime to justify
an arrest. He rejoined that {129} this was precisely in
accordance with his orders, and politely tendered me an
escort of five or six soldiers, who should be placed under
my command, to strengthen us against the Indians, that
were known to infest our route. Thanking him for his
favor, I at once started for Chihuahua, leaving the wagons
to continue slowly on the journey, and the amiable captain
with his band of <i>valientes</i> to retrace their steps at leisure
towards the capital.</p>

<p>Late on the evening of the third day, I reached the city,
and put up at the American Fonda, where I was fortunate
enough to meet with my friend Artalejo, who at once proposed
that we should proceed forthwith to the Governor's
house. When we found ourselves in the presence of his
excellency, my valued friend began by remarking that I
had returned according to orders, and that he would answer
for me with his person and property; and then, without
even waiting for a reply, he turned to me and expressed a
hope that I would make his house my residence while I
remained in the city. I could not, of course, decline so
friendly an invitation, particularly as I thought it probable <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg199"></a>[p199]</span>
that, being virtually my bail, he might prefer to have me
near his person. But, as soon as we reached the street,
he very promptly removed that suspicion from my mind.
"I invite you to my house," said he, "as a friend, and not
as a prisoner. If you have any business to transact, do
not hold yourself under the least restraint. To-morrow
I will see the affair satisfactorily settled."</p>

<p>{130} The <dfn>Junta Departamental</dfn>, or State Council, of
which Señor Artalejo was an influential member, was convened
the following day. Meanwhile, every American I met
with expressed a great deal of surprise to see me at liberty,
as, from the excitement which had existed in the city, they
expected I would have been lodged in the safest calabozo.
I was advised not to venture much into the streets, as the
rabble were very much incensed against me; but, although
I afterwards wandered about pretty freely, no one offered
to molest me; in fact, I must do the 'sovereigns of the city'
the justice to say, that I was never more politely treated
than during this occasion. Others suggested that, as
Trias was one of the most wealthy and influential citizens
of Chihuahua, I had better try to pave my way out of the
difficulty with <i>plata</i>, as I could stand no chance in law
against him. To this, however, I strenuously objected.
I felt convinced that I had been ordered back to Chihuahua
mainly for purposes of extortion, and I was determined
that the <i>oficiales</i> should be disappointed. I had unbounded
confidence in the friendship and integrity of Don José
Artalejo, who was quite an exception to the general character
of his countrymen. He was liberal, enlightened and
honorable, and I shall ever remember with gratitude the
warm interest he took in my affair, when he could have
had no other motive for befriending me except what might
spring from the consciousness of having performed a generous
action. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg200"></a>[p200]</span></p>

<p>{131} At first, when the subject of my liberation was
discussed in the <i>Junta Departamental</i>, the symptoms were
rather squally, as some bigoted and unruly members of
the Council seemed determined to have me punished,
right or wrong. After a long and tedious debate, however,
my friend brought me the draft of a petition which he
desired me to copy and sign, and upon the presentation of
which to the Governor, it had been agreed I should be
released. This step, I was informed, had been resolved
upon, because, after mature deliberation, the Council came
to the conclusion that the proceedings against me had been
extremely arbitrary and illegal, and that, if I should hereafter
prosecute the Department, I might recover heavy
damages. The wholesome lesson which had so lately
been taught the Mexicans by France, was perhaps the
cause of the fears of the Chihuahua authorities. A clause
was therefore inserted in the petition, wherein I was made
to renounce all intention on my part of ever troubling the
Department on the subject, and became myself a suppliant
to have the affair considered as concluded.</p>

<p>This petition I would never have consented to sign, had
I not been aware of the arbitrary power which was exercised
over me. Imprisonment, in itself, was of but little consequence;
but the total destruction of my property, which
might have been the result of further detention, was an
evil which I deemed it necessary to ward off, even at a great
sacrifice {132} of feeling. Moreover, being in duress, no
forced concession would, of course, be obligatory upon
me after I resumed my liberty. Again, I felt no very great
inclination to sue for redress where there was so little prospect
of procuring anything. I might certainly have represented
the matter to the Mexican government, and even
have obtained perhaps the acknowledgment of my claims
against Chihuahua for damages; but the payment would <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg201"></a>[p201]</span>
have been extremely doubtful. As to our own Government,
I had too much experience to rely for a
moment upon her interposition.</p>

<p>During the progress of these transactions, I strove to
ascertain the character of the charges made against me;
but in vain. All I knew was, that I had offended a <i>rico</i>,
and had been summoned back to Chihuahua at his instance;
yet whether for 'high treason,' for an attempt at robbery,
or for contempt to his <i>señoría</i>, I knew not. It is not unusual,
however, in that 'land of liberty,' for a person to
be arrested and even confined for weeks without knowing
the cause. The writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> appears unknown
in the judicial tribunals of Northern Mexico.</p>

<p>Upon the receipt of my petition, the Governor immediately
issued the following decree, which I translate for
the benefit of the reader, as being not a bad specimen of
Mexican grand eloquence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In consideration of the memorial which you have this day directed
to the Superior Government, His Excellency, {133} the Governor,
has been pleased to issue the following decree:</p>

<p>"'That, as Don Angel Trias has withdrawn his prosecution, so far
as relates to his personal interests, the Government, using the equity
with which it ought to look upon faults committed without a deliberate
intention to infringe the laws, which appears presumable in the
present case, owing to the memorialist's ignorance of them, the grace
which he solicits is granted to him; and, in consequence, he is at
liberty to retire when he chooses: to which end, and that he may
not be interrupted by the authorities, a copy of this decree will be
transmitted to him.'</p>

<p>"In virtue of the above, I inclose the said decree to you, for
the purposes intended.</p>

<p>"God and Liberty. <span style="margin-left:2em;">Chihuahua,
 Nov. 9, 1839.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:10em;">
"<span class="smcap">Amado de la Vega</span>, Sec.<br />
</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To Don Josiah Gregg</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>Thus terminated this 'momentous' affair. The moral
of it may be summed up in a few words. A citizen <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg202"></a>[p202]</span>
of the United States who, under the faith of treaties, is
engaged in his business, may be seized and harassed by
the arbitrary authorities of Chihuahua with perfect impunity,
because experience has proved that the American
Government winks at almost every individual outrage, as
utterly unworthy of its serious consideration. At the same
time, the Indians may enter, as they frequently do, the
suburbs of the city,—rob, plunder, and destroy life, without
a single soldier being raised, or an effort made to bring
the savage malefactors within the pale of justice. But a
few days before the occasion of my difficulty at Torreon,
the Apaches had killed a ranchero or two in the immediate
neighborhood of the same village; and afterwards, {134}
at the very time such a bustle was being made in Chihuahua
to raise troops for my 'special benefit,' the Indians entered
the corn-fields in the suburbs of the city, and killed several
<i>labradores</i> who were at work in them. In neither of these
cases, however, were there any troops at command to
pursue and chastise the depredators—though a whole
army was in readiness to persecute our party. The truth
is, they felt much less reluctance to pursue a band of civil
traders, who, they were well aware, could not assume a
hostile attitude, than to be caught in the wake of a band
of savages, who would as little respect their lives as their
laws and their property.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 10th, I once more, and for
the last time, and with anything but regret, took my leave
of Chihuahua, with my companions in trouble. Toward
the afternoon we met my old friend the captain, with his
valiant followers, whom I found as full of urbanity as ever—so
much so, indeed, that he never even asked to see my
passport.</p>

<p>On the evening of the next day, now in the heart of the
savage haunts, we were not a little alarmed by the appearance
of a large body of horsemen in the distance. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg203"></a>[p203]</span>
They turned out, however, to be <dfn>Paseños</dfn>, or citizens of the
Paso del Norte. They were on their way to Chihuahua
with a number of pack-mules laden with apples, pears,
grapes, wine, and <dfn>aguardiente</dfn>—proceeds of their productive
orchards and vineyards. It is from El Paso that
Chihuahua is chiefly supplied with fruits and {135} liquors,
which are transported on mules or in carretas. The fruits,
as well fresh as in a dried state, are thus carried to the
distant markets. The grapes, carefully dried in the shade,
make excellent <dfn>pasas</dfn> or raisins, of which large quantities
are annually prepared for market by the people of that
delightful town of vineyards and orchards, who, to take
them altogether, are more sober and industrious than those
of any other part of Mexico I have visited; and are happily
less infested by the extremes of wealth and poverty.</p>

<p>On the 13th, I overtook my wagons a few miles south
of El Paso, whence our journey was continued, without
any additional casualty, and on the 6th of December we
reached Santa Fé, in fine health and spirits.</p>

The Mexican money table
is as follows: 12 <dfn>granos</dfn> make 1 <dfn>real</dfn>; 8 <i>reales</i>, 1
<dfn>peso</dfn>, or dollar. These are the divisions used in computation, but instead of <i>granos</i>,
the copper coins of Chihuahua and many other places, are the <dfn>claco</dfn> or <dfn>jola</dfn> (<span
class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub></span> real)
and the <dfn>cuartilla</dfn> (<span

(<span class="fraction">12<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>

gold coins are the <dfn>doblon</dfn> or <dfn>onza</dfn> (doubloon), with the same subdivisions as the
silver dollar, which are also of the same weight. The par value of the doubloon is
sixteen dollars; but, as there is no kind of paper currency, gold, as the most convenient
remittance, usually commands a high premium—sometimes so high,
indeed, that the doubloon is valued in the North at from eighteen to twenty
dollars.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span></p></div>

<p>About the beginning of February, 1840, and just as I
was making preparations to return to the United States, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg204"></a>[p204]</span>
the small-pox broke out among my men, in a manner which
at first occasioned at least as much astonishment as alarm.
One of them, who had been vaccinated, having travelled
in a district where the small-pox prevailed, complained
of a little fever, which was followed by slight eruptions,
but so unlike true variolous pustules, that I treated the
matter very lightly; not even suspecting a varioloid. These
slight symptoms {137} having passed off, nothing more
was thought of it until eight or ten days after, when every
unvaccinated member of our company was attacked by
that fell disease, which soon began to manifest very malignant
features. There were no fatal cases, however; yet
much apprehension was felt, lest the disease should break
out again on the route; but, to our great joy, we escaped
this second scourge.</p>

<p>A party that left Santa Fé for Missouri soon afterward,
was much more unfortunate. On the way, several of their
men were attacked by the small-pox: some of them died,
and, others retaining the infection till they approached
the Missouri frontier, they were compelled to undergo a
'quarantine' in the bordering prairie, before they were
permitted to enter the settlements.</p>

<p>On the 25th of February we set out from Santa Fé; but
owing to some delays, we did not leave San Miguel till
the 1st of March. As the pasturage was yet insufficient
for our animals, we here provided ourselves with over six
hundred bushels of corn, to feed them on the way. This
time our caravan consisted of twenty-eight wagons, two
small cannons, and forty-seven men, including sixteen
Mexicans and a Comanche Indian who acted in the capacity
of guide.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Two gentlemen of Baltimore, {138} Messrs. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg205"></a>[p205]</span>
S. Wethered and J. R. Ware, had joined our caravan with
one wagon and three men, making up the aggregate above-mentioned.
We had also a caballada of more than two
hundred mules, with nearly three hundred sheep and
goats. The sheep were brought along partially to supply
us with meat in case of emergency: the surplusage, however,
could not fail to command a fair price in the United
States.</p>

<p>Instead of following the trail of the year before, I determined
to seek a nearer and better route down the south
side of the Canadian river, under the guidance of the Comanche;
by which movement, we had again to travel a distance
of four hundred miles over an entirely new country. We
had just passed the Laguna Colorada, where, the following
year, a division of Texan volunteers, under General McLeod,
surrendered to Col. Archuleta,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> when our fire was
carelessly permitted to communicate with the prairie grass.
As there was a head-wind blowing at the time, we very
soon got out of reach of the conflagration: but the next day,
the wind having changed, the fire was again perceived in
our rear approaching us at a very brisk pace. The terror <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg206"></a>[p206]</span>
which these prairie conflagrations are calculated to inspire,
when the grass is tall and dry, as was the case in the present
instance, has often {139} been described, and though the
perils of these disasters are not unfrequently exaggerated,
they are sometimes sufficient to daunt the stoutest heart.
Mr. Kendall relates a frightful incident of this kind which
occurred to the Texan Santa Fé Exposition; and all those
who have crossed the Prairies have had more or less experience
as to the danger which occasionally threatens the
caravans from these sweeping visitations. The worst
evil to be apprehended with those bound for Santa Fé is
from the explosion of gunpowder, as a keg or two of twenty-five
pounds each, is usually to be found in every wagon.
When we saw the fire gaining so rapidly upon us, we had
to use the whip very unsparingly; and it was only when
the lurid flames were actually rolling upon the heels of our
teams, that we succeeded in reaching a spot of short-grass
prairie, where there was no further danger to be apprehended.</p>

<p>The headway of the conflagration was soon after checked
by a small stream which traversed our route; and we had
only emerged fairly from its smoke, on the following day
(the 9th), when our Comanche guide returned hastily
from his accustomed post in advance, and informed us that
he had espied three buffaloes, not far off. They were
the first we had met with, and, being heartily anxious for
a change from the dried beef with which we were provided,
I directed the Comanche, who was by far our surest hunter,
to prepare at once for the <i>chasse</i>. He said he preferred to
hunt on {140} horseback and with his bow and arrow; and
believing my riding-horse the fleetest in company (which,
by the by, was but a common pony, and thin in flesh withal),
I dismounted and gave him the bridle, with many charges
to treat him kindly, as we still had a long journey before <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg207"></a>[p207]</span>
us. "Don't attempt to kill but one—that will serve us
for the present!" I exclaimed, as he galloped off. The
Comanche was among the largest of his tribe—bony and
muscular—weighing about two hundred pounds: but
once at his favorite sport, he very quickly forgot my injunction,
as well as the weakness of my little pony. He
soon brought down two of his game,—and shyly remarked
to those who followed in his wake, that, had he not feared
a scolding from me, he would not have permitted the third
to escape.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 10th our camp was pitched in
the neighborhood of a ravine in the prairie, and as the
night was dark and dreary, the watch tried to comfort
themselves by building a rousing fire, around which they
presently drew, and commenced 'spinning long yarns'
about Mexican fandangoes, and black-eyed damsels. All
of a sudden the stillness of the night was interrupted by
a loud report of fire-arms, and a shower of bullets came
whizzing by the ears of the heedless sentinels. Fortunately,
however, no one was injured; which must be looked upon
as a very extraordinary circumstance, when we consider
what a fair mark our men, thus huddled {141} round a
blazing fire, presented to the rifles of the Indians. The
savage yells, which resounded from every part of the ravine,
bore very satisfactory testimony that this was no false
alarm; and the 'Pawnee whistle' which was heard in every
quarter, at once impressed us with the idea of its being a
band of that famous prairie banditti.</p>

<p>Every man sprang from his pallet with rifle in hand; for,
upon the Prairies, we always sleep with our arms by our
sides or under our heads. Our Comanche seemed at first
very much at a loss what to do. At last, thinking it might
possibly be a band of his own nation, he began a most
boisterous harangue in his vernacular tongue, which he <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg208"></a>[p208]</span>
continued for several minutes; when finding that the enemy
took no notice of him, and having become convinced also,
from an occasional Pawnee word which he was able to
make out, that he had been wasting breath with the mortal
foes of his race, he suddenly ceased all expostulations, and
blazed away with his rifle, with a degree of earnestness
which was truly edifying, as if convinced that that was
the best he could do for us.</p>

<p>It was now evident that the Indians had taken possession
of the entire ravine, the nearest points of which were not
fifty yards from our wagons: a warning to prairie travellers
to encamp at a greater distance from whatsoever might
afford shelter for an enemy. The banks of the gully were
low, but still they formed a very good breastwork, behind
which {142} the enemy lay ensconced, discharging volleys
of balls upon our wagons, among which we were scattered.
At one time we thought of making an attempt to rout them
from their fortified position; but being ignorant of their
number, and unable to distinguish any object through
the dismal darkness which hung all around, we had to
remain content with firing at random from behind our
wagons, aiming at the flash of their guns, or in the direction
whence any noise appeared to emanate. Indeed their
yelling was almost continuous, breaking out every now
and then in the most hideous screams and vociferous chattering,
which were calculated to appal such timorous persons
as we may have had in our caravan. All their screeching
and whooping, however, had no effect—they could
not make our animals break from the enclosure of the
wagons, in which they were fortunately shut up; which
was no doubt their principal object for attacking us.</p>

<p>I cannot forbear recording a most daring feat performed
by a Mexican muleteer, named Antonio Chavez, during
the hottest of the first onset. Seeing the danger of my <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg209"></a>[p209]</span>
two favorite riding horses, which were tethered outside
within a few paces of the savages, he rushed out and brought
safely in the most valuable of the two, though fusil-balls
were showering around him all the while. The other
horse broke his halter and made his escape.</p>

<p>Although sundry scores of shots had been fired at our
people, we had only two men {143} wounded. One, a
Mexican, was but slightly injured in the hand, but the
wound of the other, who was an Italian, bore a more serious
aspect, and deserves especial mention. He was a short,
corpulent fellow, and had been nicknamed 'Dutch'—a
loquacious, chicken-hearted <i>fainéant</i>, and withal in the
daily habit of gorging himself to such an enormous extent,
that every alternate night he was on the sick list. On this
memorable occasion, Dutch had 'foundered' again, and
the usual prescription of a double dose of Epsom salts had
been his supper potion. The skirmish had continued
for about an hour, and although a frightful groaning had
been heard in Dutch's wagon for some time, no one paid
any attention to it, as it was generally supposed to be from
the effects of his dose. At length, however, some one
cried out, "Dutch is wounded!" I immediately went to
see him, and found him writhing and twisting himself as
if in great pain, crying all the time that he was shot. "Shot!—where?"
I inquired. "Ah! in the head, sir?" "Pshaw!
Dutch, none of that; you've only bumped your head in
trying to hide yourself." Upon lighting a match, however,
I found that a ball had passed through the middle of his
hat, and that, to my consternation, the top of his head was
bathed in blood. It turned out, upon subsequent examination,
that the ball had glanced upon the skull, inflicting
a serious-looking wound, and so deep that an inch of sound
skin separated the holes at which the {144} bullet had entered
and passed out. Notwithstanding I at first apprehended <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg210"></a>[p210]</span>
a fracture of the scull, it very soon healed, and Dutch was
'up and about' again in the course of a week.</p>

<p>Although teachers not unfrequently have cause to deplore
the thickness of their pupils' skulls, Dutch had every
reason to congratulate himself upon possessing such a
treasure, as it had evidently preserved him from a more
serious catastrophe. It appeared he had taken shelter
in his wagon at the commencement of the attack, without
reflecting that the boards and sheets were not ball-proof:
and as Indians, especially in the night, are apt to shoot
too high, he was in a much more dangerous situation than
if upon the ground.</p>

<p>The enemy continued the attack for nearly three hours,
when they finally retired, so as to make good their retreat
before daylight. As it rained and snowed from that time
till nine in the morning, their 'sign' was almost entirely
obliterated, and we were unable to discover whether they
had received any injury or not. It was evidently a foot
party, which we looked upon as another proof of their
being Pawnees; for these famous marauders are well known
to go forth on their expeditions of plunder without horses,
although they seldom fail to return well mounted.</p>

<p>Their shot had riddled our wagons considerably: in one
we counted no less than eight bullet-holes. We had the
gratification to believe, however, that they did not get a
single {145} one of our animals: the horse which broke
away at the first onset, doubtless made his escape; and a
mule which was too badly wounded to travel, was dispatched
by the muleteers, lest it should fall into the hands of the
savages, or into the mouths of the wolves; and they deemed
it more humane to leave it to be eaten dead than alive.
We also experienced considerable damage in our stock of
sheep, a number of them having been devoured by wolves.
They had been scattered at the beginning of the attack; <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg211"></a>[p211]</span>
and, in their anxiety to fly from the scene of action, had
jumped, as it were, into the very jaws of their ravenous
enemies.</p>

<p>On the 12th of March, we ascended upon the celebrated
<i>Llano Estacado</i>, and continued along its borders for a few
days. The second night upon this dreary plain, we experienced
one of the strongest and bleakest 'northwesters'
that ever swept across those prairies; during which, our
flock of sheep and goats, being left unattended, fled over
the plain, in search of some shelter, it was supposed, from
the furious element. Their disappearance was not observed
for some time, and the night being too dark to discern
anything, we were obliged to defer going in pursuit of them
till the following morning. After a fruitless and laborious
search, during which the effects of the mirage proved a
constant source of annoyance and disappointment, we
were finally obliged to relinquish the pursuit, and return
to the caravan without finding one of them.</p>

<p>{146} These severe winds are very prevalent upon the
great western prairies, though they are seldom quite so
inclement. At some seasons, they are about as regular
and unceasing as the 'trade winds' of the ocean. It will
often blow a gale for days, and even weeks together, without
slacking for a moment, except occasionally at night. It
is for this reason, as well as on account of the rains, that
percussion guns are preferable upon the Prairies, particularly
for those who understand their use. The winds are
frequently so severe as to sweep away both sparks and
priming from a flint lock, and thus render it wholly ineffective.</p>

<p>The following day we continued our march down the
border of the Llano Estacado. Knowing that our Comanche
guide was about as familiar with all those great plains as
a landlord with his premises, I began to question him, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg212"></a>[p212]</span>
as we travelled along, concerning the different streams
which pierced them to the southward. Pointing in that
direction, he said there passed a water-course, at the distance
of a hard day's ride, which he designated as a <dfn>cañada</dfn> or
valley, in which there was always water to be found at
occasional places, but that none flowed in its channel except
during the rainy season. This cañada he described
as having its origin in the Llano Estacado some fifty or
sixty miles east of Rio Pecos, and about the same distance
south of the route we came, and that its direction was a
little south of east, passing to the southward {147} of the
northern portion of the Witchita mountains, known to
Mexican Ciboleros and Comancheros as <dfn>Sierra Jumanes</dfn>.
It was, therefore, evident that this was the principal northern
branch of Red River. The False Washita, or <dfn>Rio
Negro</dfn>, as the Mexicans call it, has its rise, as he assured
me, between the Canadian and this cañada, at no great
distance of the southeastward of where we were then travelling.</p>

<p>On the 15th, our Comanche guide, being fearful lest we
should find no water upon the plain, advised us to pursue
a more northwardly course, so that, after a hard day's
ride, we again descended the <dfn>ceja</dfn> or brow of the Llano
Estacado, into the undulating lands which border the
Canadian; and, on the following day, we found ourselves
upon the southern bank of that stream.</p>

<p>Although, but a few days' travel above where we now
were, the Canadian runs pent up in a narrow channel,
scarcely four rods across, we here found it spread out to
the width of from three to six hundred yards, and so full
of sand-bars (only interspersed with narrow rills) as to
present the appearance of a mere sandy valley instead of
the bed of a river. In fact, during the driest seasons, the
water wholly disappears in many places. Captain Boone,
of the U. S. Dragoons, being upon an exploring expedition <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg213"></a>[p213]</span>
in the summer of 1843, came to the Canadian about the
region of our western boundary, where he found the channel
perfectly dry.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Notwithstanding {148} it presents the
face of one of the greatest rivers of the west during freshets,
yet even then it would not be navigable on account of its
rapidity and shallowness. It would appear almost incredible
to those unacquainted with the prairie streams, that a
river of about 1500 miles in length, and whose head wears
a cap of perennial snow (having its source in the Rocky
Mountains), should scarcely be navigable, for even the
smallest craft, over fifty miles above its mouth.</p>

<p>We pursued our course down the same side of the river
for several days, during which time we crossed a multitude
of little streams which flowed into the Canadian from the
adjoining plains, while others presented nothing but dry
beds of sand. One of these was so remarkable, on account
of its peculiarity and size, that we named it 'Dry River.'
The bed was at least 200 yards wide, yet without a vestige
of water; notwithstanding, our guide assured us that it
was a brisk-flowing stream some leagues above: and from
the drift-wood along its borders, it was evident that, even
here, it must be a considerable river during freshets.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>While traveling down the course of the Canadian, we
sometimes found the buffalo very abundant. On one <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg214"></a>[p214]</span>
occasion, two or three hunters, who were a little in advance
of the caravan, perceiving a herd quietly grazing in an
open glade, they 'crawled upon' them after the manner
of the 'still hunters.' Their first shot having brought down
a fine {149} fat cow, they slipped up behind her, and, resting
their guns over her body, shot two or three others, without
occasioning any serious disturbance or surprise to their
companions; for, extraordinary as it may appear, if the
buffalo neither see nor smell the hunter, they will pay but
little attention to the crack of guns, or to the mortality
which is being dealt among them.</p>

<p>The slaughter of these animals is frequently carried
to an excess, which shows the depravity of the human heart
in very bold relief. Such is the excitement that generally
prevails at the sight of these fat denizens of the prairies,
that very few hunters appear able to refrain from shooting
as long as the game remains within reach of their rifles;
nor can they ever permit a fair shot to escape them. Whether
the mere pleasure of taking life is {150} the incentive of
these brutal excesses, I will not pretend to decide; but
one thing is very certain, that the buffalo killed yearly on
these prairies far exceeds the wants of the traveller, or
what might be looked upon as the exigencies of rational
sport.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>But in making these observations, I regret that I cannot
give to my precepts the force of my own example: I have
not always been able wholly to withstand the cruel temptation.
Not long after the incident above alluded to, as I
was pioneering alone, according to my usual practice, at
a distance of a mile or two ahead of the wagons, in search
of the best route, I perceived in a glade, a few rods in front <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg215"></a>[p215]</span>
of me, several protuberances, which at first occasioned
me no little fright, for I took them, as they loomed dimly
through the tall grass, for the tops of Indian lodges. But
I soon discovered they were the huge humps of a herd of
buffalo, which were quietly grazing.</p>

<p>I immediately alighted, and approached unobserved
to within forty or fifty yards of the unsuspecting animals.
Being armed with one of Cochran's nine-chambered rifles,
I took aim at one that stood broad-side, and 'blazed away.'
The buffalo threw up their heads and looked about, but
seeing nothing (for I remained concealed in the grass),
they again {151} went on grazing as though nothing had
happened. The truth is, the one I had shot was perhaps
but little hurt; for, as generally happens with the inexperienced
hunter—and often with those who know better,
the first excitement allowing no time for reflection—I
no doubt aimed too high, so as to lodge the ball in the hump.
A buffalo's heart lies exceedingly low, so that to strike it
the shot should enter not over one-fourth of the depth of
the body above the lower edge of the breast bone.</p>

<p>The brutes were no sooner quiet, than I took another
and more deliberate aim at my former victim, which resulted
as before. But believing him now mortally wounded,
I next fired in quick succession at four others of the gang.
It occurred to me, by this time, that I had better save my
remaining three shots; for it was possible enough for my
firing to attract the attention of strolling savages, who
might take advantage of my empty gun to make a sortie
upon me—yet there stood my buffalo, some of them still
quietly feeding.</p>

<p>As I walked out from my concealment, a party of our
own men came galloping up from the wagons, considerably
alarmed. They had heard the six shots, and, not recollecting
my repeating rifle, supposed I had been attacked <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg216"></a>[p216]</span>
by Indians, and therefore came to my relief. Upon their
approach the buffalo all fled, except three which appeared
badly wounded—one indeed soon fell and expired. The
other two would doubtless have followed {152} the example
of the first, had not a hunter, anxious to dispatch them
more speedily, approached too near; when, regaining
strength from the excitement, they fled before him, and
entirely escaped, though he pursued them for a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>A few days after this occurrence, Mr. Wethered returned
to the camp one evening with seven buffalo tongues (the
hunter's usual trophy) swung to his saddle. He said that,
in the morning, one of the hunters had ungenerously objected
to sharing a buffalo with him; whereupon Mr. W.
set out, vowing he would kill buffalo for himself, and 'no
thanks to any one.' He had not been out long when he
spied a herd of only seven bulls, quietly feeding near a
ravine; and slipping up behind the banks, he shot down
one and then another, until they all lay before him; and
their seven tongues he brought in to bear testimony of
his skill.</p>

<p>Not long after crossing Dry River, we ascended the high
grounds, and soon found ourselves upon the high ridge
which divides the waters of the Canadian and False Washita,
whose 'breaks' could be traced descending from the Llano
Estacado far to the southwest.</p>

<p>By an observation of an eclipse of one of Jupiter's satellites,
on the night of the 25th of March, in latitude <span
class="fraction">35° 51′ 30″,</span> I found that we were very near the 100th degree
of longitude west from Greenwich. On the following day,
therefore, we celebrated our entrance into the United States
territory. Those who {153} have never been beyond the
purlieus of the land of their nativity, can form but a poor
conception of the joy which the wanderer in distant climes <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg217"></a>[p217]</span>
experiences on treading once more upon his own native
soil! Although we were yet far from the abodes of civilization,
and further still from home, nevertheless the heart
within us thrilled with exhilarating sensations; for we were
again in our own territory, breathed our own free atmosphere,
and were fairly out of reach of the arbitrary power
which we had left behind us.</p>

<p>As we continued our route upon this narrow dividing
ridge, we could not help remarking how nearly these streams
approach each other: in one place they seemed scarcely
five miles apart. On this account our Comanche guide,
as well as several Mexicans of our party, who had some
acquaintance with these prairies, gave it as their opinion
that the Washita or <i>Rio Negro</i> was in fact a branch of the
Canadian; for its confluence with Red River was beyond
the bounds of their peregrinations.</p>

<p>As the forest of Cross Timbers was now beginning to be
seen in the distance, and fearing we might be troubled to
find a passway through this brushy region, south of the
Canadian, we forded this river on the 29th, without the
slightest trouble, and very soon entered our former trail,
a little west of Spring Valley. This gave a new and joyful
impulse to our spirits; for we had been travelling over
twenty days without even a trail, {154} and through a region
of which we knew absolutely nothing, except from what we
could gather from our Comanche pilot. This trail, which
our wagons had made the previous summer, was still visible,
and henceforth there was an end to all misgivings.</p>

<p>If we take a retrospective view of the country over which
we travelled, we shall find but little that can ever present
attractions to the agriculturist. Most of the low valleys
of the Canadian, for a distance of five hundred miles, are
either too sandy or too marshy for cultivation; and the
upland prairies are, in many places, but little else than <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg218"></a>[p218]</span>
sand-hills. In some parts, it is true, they are firm and
fertile, but wholly destitute of timber, with the exception
of a diminutive branch of the Cross Timbers, which occupies
a portion of the ridge betwixt the Canadian and the
North Fork. The Canadian river itself is still more bare
of timber than the upper Arkansas. In its whole course
through the plains, there is but little except cottonwood,
and that very scantily scattered along its banks—in some
places, for leagues together, not a stick is to be seen. Except
it be near the Mountains, where the valleys are more
fertile, it is only the little narrow bottoms which skirt many
of its tributary rivulets that indicate any amenity. Some
of these are rich and beautiful in the extreme, timbered
with walnut, mulberry, oak, elm, hackberry, and occasionally
cedar about the bluffs.</p>

<p>We now continued our journey without encountering
any further casualty, except in {155} crossing the Arkansas
river, where we lost several mules by drowning; and on
the 22d of April we made our entrance into Van Buren.
This trip was much more tedious and protracted than I
had contemplated—owing, in the first part of the journey,
to the inclemency of the season, and a want of pasturage
for our animals; and, towards the conclusion, to the frequent
rains, which kept the route in a miserable condition.</p>

<p>Concerning this expedition, I have only one or two more
remarks to offer. As regards the two different routes to
Santa Fé, although Missouri, for various reasons which
it is needless to explain here, can doubtless retain the
monopoly of the Santa Fé trade, the route from Arkansas
possesses many advantages. Besides its being some days'
travel shorter,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> it is less intersected with large streams;
there are fewer sandy stretches, and a greater variety of <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg219"></a>[p219]</span>
wood-skirted brooks, affording throughout the journey
very agreeable camping-places. Also, as the grass springs
up nearly a month earlier than in Upper Missouri, caravans
could start much sooner, and the proprietors would have
double the time to conduct their mercantile transactions.
Moreover, the return companies would find better pasturage
on their way back, and reach their homes before the
season of frost had far advanced. Again, such as should
desire to engage in the 'stock {156} trade' would at once
bring their mules and horses into a more congenial climate—one
more in accordance with that of their nativity; for
the rigorous winters of Missouri often prove fatal to the
unacclimated Mexican animals.</p>

<p>This was my last trip across the Plains, though I made
an excursion, during the following summer, among the
Comanche Indians, and other wild tribes, living in the
heart of the Prairies, but returned without crossing to
Mexico. The observations made during this trip will
be found incorporated in the notices, which are to follow,
of the Prairies and their inhabitants.</p>

<p>Since that time I have striven in vain to reconcile myself
to the even tenor of civilized life in the United States; and
have sought in its amusements and its society a substitute
for those high excitements which have attached me so
strongly to Prairie life. Yet I am almost ashamed to
confess that scarcely a day passes without my experiencing
a pang of regret that I am not now roving at large upon
those western plains. Nor do I find my taste peculiar;
for I have hardly known a man, who has ever become
familiar with the kind of life which I have led for so many
years, that has not relinquished it with regret.</p>

<p>There is more than one way of explaining this apparent
incongruity. In the first place—the wild, unsettled and
independent life of the Prairie trader, makes perfect freedom <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg220"></a>[p220]</span>
from nearly every kind of social dependence an absolute
necessity of his being. He is in {157} daily, nay, hourly exposure
of his life and property, and in the habit of relying
upon his own arm and his own gun both for protection
and support. Is he wronged? No court or jury is called
to adjudicate upon his disputes or his abuses, save his
own conscience; and no powers are invoked to redress
them, save those with which the God of Nature has endowed
him. He knows no government—no laws, save
those of his own creation and adoption. He lives in no
society which he must look up to or propitiate. The
exchange of this untrammelled condition—this sovereign
independence, for a life in civilization, where both his
physical and moral freedom are invaded at every turn,
by the complicated machinery of social institutions, is
certainly likely to commend itself to but few,—not even
to all those who have been educated to find their enjoyments
in the arts and elegancies peculiar to civilized society;—as
is evinced by the frequent instances of men of letters,
of refinement and of wealth, voluntarily abandoning society
for a life upon the Prairies, or in the still more savage
mountain wilds.</p>

<p>A 'tour on the Prairies' is certainly a <em>dangerous</em> experiment
for him who would live a quiet contented life at home
among his friends and relatives: not so dangerous to life
or health, as prejudicial to his domestic habits. Those
who have lived pent up in our large cities, know but little
of the broad, unembarrassed freedom of the Great Western
Prairies. {158} Viewing them from a snug fire-side, they
seem crowded with dangers, with labors and with sufferings;
but once upon them, and these appear to vanish—they
are soon forgotten.</p>

<p>There is another consideration, which, with most men
of the Prairies, operates seriously against their reconciliation
to the habits of civilized life. Though they be <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg221"></a>[p221]</span>
endowed naturally with the organs of taste and refinement,
and though once familiar with the ways and practices of
civilized communities, yet a long absence from such society
generally obliterates from their minds most of those common
laws of social intercourse, which are so necessary to
the man of the world. The awkwardness and the <i>gaucheries</i>
which ignorance of their details so often involves, are
very trying to all men of sensitive temperaments. Consequently,
multitudes rush back to the Prairies, merely
to escape those criticisms and that ridicule, which they
know not how to disarm.</p>

<p>It will hardly be a matter of surprise then, when I add,
that this passion for Prairie life, how paradoxical soever
it may seem, will be very apt to lead me upon the
Plains again, to spread my bed with the mustang and the
buffalo, under the broad canopy of heaven,—there to
seek to maintain undisturbed my confidence in men, by
fraternizing with the little prairie dogs and wild colts, and
the still wilder Indians—the <i>unconquered Sabæans</i> of
the Great American Deserts.</p>

class="toclnk">toc</a></p>

<p>Before proceeding to the graver matters to be presented
in the succeeding chapters, a few words to those
who are curious about the history of the Santa Fé trade <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg222"></a>[p222]</span>
intervening between the conclusion of my personal narrative
and the closing of the trade by the Mexican government,
in 1843, may not be amiss.</p>

<p>The Santa Fé trade, though more or less fluctuating
from its origin, continued to present an average increase
and growth down to the year 1831. During the same period,
the prices of goods continued to go down in even a more
rapid ratio. Since 1831, the rates of {160} sales have continued
steadily to fall, to the latest period of the trade,
although there has been no average increase in the number
of adventurers, or amount of merchandise.<a name="FNanchor_136_136"
id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136"
class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>{161} From 1831 to the present date, prices have scarcely
averaged, for medium calicoes, thirty-seven cents, and
for plain domestic cottons thirty-one cents per yard. Taking <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg223"></a>[p223]</span>
assortments round, 100 per cent, upon United States
costs were generally considered excellent sales: many
stocks have been sold at a much lower rate. The average
prices of Chihuahua are equally low, yet a brisker demand
has rendered this the most agreeable and profitable branch
of the trade.</p>

<p>{162} The first attempt to introduce American goods
into the more southern markets of Mexico from Santa Fé,
was made in the year 1824. The amounts were very small,
however, till towards the year 1831. For a few of the first
years, the traders were in the habit of conveying small lots
to Sonora and California; but this branch of the trade has,
I believe, latterly ceased altogether. Yet the amounts
transferred to Chihuahua have generally increased; so
that for the last few years, that trade has consumed very
nearly half of the entire imports by the Missouri Caravans.</p>

<p>The entire consumption of foreign goods in the department
of Chihuahua, has been estimated by intelligent
Mexican merchants, at from two to three millions annually; <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg224"></a>[p224]</span>
the first cost of which might be set down at nearly one half.
Of this amount the Santa Fé trade, as will be seen from
the accompanying table, has not furnished a tenth part;
the balance being introduced through other ports, viz.:
<i>Matamoras</i>, whence Chihuahua has received nearly half
its supplies—<i>Vera Cruz</i> via the city of Mexico, whence
considerable amounts have been brought to this department—<i>Tampico</i>
on the Gulf of Mexico, and <i>Mazatlan</i>
on the Pacific, via Durango, whence the imports have been
of some importance—while nearly all the west of the
department, and especially the heavy consumption of the
mining town of Jesus-Maria, receives most of its supplies
from the port of <i>Guaymas</i> on the Gulf of {163} California;
whence, indeed, several stocks of goods have been introduced
as far as the city of Chihuahua itself. In 1840, a
large amount of merchandise was transported directly
from the Red River frontier of Arkansas to Chihuahua; but
no other expedition has ever been made in that direction.<a
name="FNanchor_137_138" id="FNanchor_137_138"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_137_138" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg225"></a>[p225]</span></p>

<p> {164} By far the greatest portion of the introductions
through the sea-ports just alluded to, have been made
by British merchants. It is chiefly the preference given
to American manufacturers, which has enabled the merchandise
of the Santa Fé adventurers to compete in the
Southern markets, with goods introduced through the
sea-ports, which have had the {165} benefit of the drawback.
In this last respect our traders have labored under
a very unjust burden.</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive any equitable reason why merchants
conveying their goods across the Prairies in wagons,
should not be as much entitled to the protection of the
Government, as those who transport them in vessels across
the ocean. This assistance (with the reopening of the
ports) might enable our merchants to monopolize the rich
trade of Chihuahua; and they would obtain a share of
that of the still richer departments of Durango and Zacatecas,
as well as some portion of the Sonora and California <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg226"></a>[p226]</span>
trade. Then rating that of Chihuahua at two millions,
half that of Durango at the same, and a million from
Zacatecas, Sonora, etc., it would ascend to the clever amount
of some five millions of dollars per annum.</p>

<p>In point of revenue, the Santa Fé trade has been
of but little importance to the government of Mexico.
Though the amount of duties collected annually at this
port has usually been fifty to eighty thousand dollars, yet
nearly one-half has been embezzled by the officers of the
customs, leaving an average net revenue of perhaps less
than forty thousand dollars per annum.</p>

<p>It is not an unimportant fact to be known, that, since
the year 1831, few or none of the difficulties and dangers
which once environed the Santa Fé adventurer have been
encountered. No traders have been killed by the {166}
savages on the regular route, and but few animals stolen
from the caravans. On the whole, the rates of insurance
upon adventures in this trade should hardly be as high
as upon marine adventures between New York and Liverpool.
While I declare, however, the serious dangers and
troubles to have been in general so slight, I ought not to
suppress at least an outline of the difficulties that occurred
on the Prairies in 1843, which were attended with very
serious consequences. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg227"></a>[p227]</span></p>

<p>It had been reported in Santa Fé as early as November,
1842, that a party of Texans were upon the Prairies, prepared
to attack any Mexican traders who should cross
the plains the succeeding spring; and as some Americans
were accused of being spies, and in collusion with the
Texans, many were ordered to Santa Fé for examination,
occasioning a deal of trouble to several innocent persons.
Than this, however, but little further attention was paid
to the report, many believing it but another of those rumors
of Texan invasion which had so often spread useless consternation
through the country.</p>

<p>So little apprehension appeared to exist, that, in February,
1843, Don Antonio José Chavez, of New Mexico, left
Santa Fé for Independence, with but five servants, two
wagons, and fifty-five mules. He had with him some ten
or twelve thousand dollars in specie and gold bullion, besides
a small lot of furs. As the month of March was
extremely inclement, the little party suffered inconceivably
{167} from cold and privations. Most of them were frost-bitten,
and all their animals, except five, perished from
the extreme severity of the season; on which account Chavez
was compelled to leave one of his wagons upon the Prairies.
He had worried along, however, with his remaining wagon
and valuables, till about the tenth of April, when he found
himself near the Little Arkansas; at least a hundred miles <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg228"></a>[p228]</span>
within the territory of the United States. He was there
met by fifteen men from the border of Missouri, professing
to be Texan troops, under the command of one John
M'Daniel. This party had been collected, for the most
part, on the frontier, by their leader, who was recently
from Texas, from which government he professed to hold
a captain's commission. They started no doubt with the
intention of joining one Col. Warfield (also said to hold a
Texan commission), who had been upon the Plains near
the Mountains, with a small party, for several months—with
the avowed intention of attacking the Mexican traders.</p>

<p>Upon meeting Chavez, however, the party of M'Daniel
at once determined to make sure of the prize he was possessed
of, rather than take their chances of a similar booty
beyond the U. S. boundary. The unfortunate Mexican
was therefore taken a few miles south of the road, and his
baggage rifled. Seven of the party then left for the settlements
with their share of the booty, amounting to some
four or five hundred dollars apiece; making the journey
on foot, as their horses had taken {168} a stampede and
escaped. The remaining eight, soon after the departure
of their comrades, determined to put Chavez to death,—for
what cause it would seem difficult to conjecture, as
he had been, for two days, their unresisting prisoner. Lots
were accordingly cast to determine which four of the party
should be the cruel executioners; and their wretched victim
was taken off a few rods and shot down in cold blood.
After his murder a considerable amount of gold was found
about his person, and in his trunk. The body of the unfortunate
man, together with his wagon and baggage,
was thrown into a neighboring ravine; and a few of the
lost animals of the marauders having been found, their
booty was packed upon them and borne away to the frontier
of Missouri. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg229"></a>[p229]</span></p>

<p>Great exertions had been made to intercept this lawless
band at the outset; but they escaped the vigilance even
of a detachment of dragoons that had followed them over
a hundred miles. Yet the honest citizens of the border
were too much on the alert to permit them to return to
the interior with impunity. However, five of the whole
number (including three of the party that killed the man)
effected their escape, but the other ten were arrested, committed,
and sent to St. Louis for trial before the United
States Court. It appears that those who were engaged
in the killing of Chavez have since been convicted of murder;
and the others, who were only concerned in the robbery,
were found guilty {169} of larceny, and sentenced to fine
and imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_138_139" id="FNanchor_138_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_139" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>About the first of May of the same year, a company of
a hundred and seventy-five men, under one Col. Snively,
was organized in the north of Texas, and set out from the
settlements for the Santa Fé trace. It was at first reported
that they contemplated a descent upon Santa Fé;
but their force was evidently too weak to attempt an invasion
at that crisis. Their prime object, therefore, seems
to have been to attack and make reprisals upon the Mexicans
engaged in the Santa Fé trade, who were expected to cross
the Prairies during the months of May and June.</p>

<p>After the arrival of the Texans upon the Arkansas, they
were joined by Col. Warfield with a few followers. This
officer, with about twenty men, had some time previously
attacked the village of Mora, on the Mexican frontier,
killing five men (as was reported) and driving off a number
of horses.<a name="FNanchor_139_140" id="FNanchor_139_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_140" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> They were afterwards followed by a party <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg230"></a>[p230]</span>
of Mexicans, however, who <i>stampeded</i> and carried away,
not only their own horses, but those of the Texans. Being
left afoot the latter burned their saddles, and walked to
Bent's Fort, where they were disbanded; whence Warfield
passed to Snively's camp, as before mentioned.</p>

<p>The Texans now advanced along the Santa Fé road,
beyond the sand hills south of the Arkansas, when they
discovered that a party of Mexicans had passed towards
the river. They soon came upon them, and a skirmish
{170} ensuing, eighteen Mexicans were killed, and as many
wounded, five of whom afterwards died. The Texans
suffered no injury, though the Mexicans were a hundred
in number. The rest were all taken prisoners except two,
who escaped and bore the news to Gen. Armijo, encamped
with a large force at the Cold Spring, 140 miles beyond.
As soon as the General received notice of the defeat of his
vanguard, he broke up his camp most precipitately, and retreated
to Santa Fé. A gentleman of the caravan which
passed shortly afterward, informed me that spurs, lareats
and other scraps of equipage, were found scattered in
every direction about Armijo's camp—left by his troops
in the hurly-burly of their precipitate retreat.<a name="FNanchor_140_141" id="FNanchor_140_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_141" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Keeping beyond the territory of the United States, the
right of the Texans to harass the commerce of Mexicans
will hardly be denied, as they were at open war: yet another
consideration, it would seem, should have restrained them
from aggressions in that quarter. They could not have
been ignorant that but a portion of the traders were Mexicans—that
many American citizens were connected in <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg231"></a>[p231]</span>
the same caravans. The Texans assert, it is true, that the
lives and property of Americans were to be respected,
<em>provided</em> they abandoned the Mexicans. But did they
reflect upon the baseness of the terms they were imposing?
What American, worthy of the name, to save his own
interests, or even his life, could deliver up his travelling
companions {171} to be sacrificed? Then, after having
abandoned the Mexicans, or betrayed them to their enemy—for
such an act would have been accounted treachery—where
would they have gone? They could not then have
continued on into Mexico; and to have returned to the United
States with their merchandise, would have been the ruin
of most of them.</p>

<p>The inhuman outrages suffered by those who were
captured in New Mexico in 1841, among whom were many
of the present party, have been pleaded in justification of
this second Texan expedition. When we take their grievances
into consideration, we must admit that they palliate,
and indeed justify almost any species of revenge
consistent with the laws of Nature and of nations: yet
whether, under the existing circumstances, this invasion
of the Prairies was proper or otherwise, I will leave for
others to determine, as there seems to be a difference of
opinion on the subject. The following considerations,
however, will go to demonstrate the unpropitious consequences
which are apt to result from a system of indiscriminate
revenge.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Chavez (whose murder, I suppose,
was perpetrated under pretext of the cruelties suffered by
the Texans, in the name of whom the party of M'Daniel
was organized) was of the most wealthy and influential
family of New Mexico, and one that was anything but
friendly to the ruling governor, Gen. Armijo. Don Mariano
Chavez, a brother to the deceased, is a gentleman of very <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg232"></a>[p232]</span>
amiable {172} character, such as is rarely to be met with
in that unfortunate land. It is asserted that he furnished
a considerable quantity of provisions, blankets, etc., to
Col. Cooke's division of Texan prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_141_142" id="FNanchor_141_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_142" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Señora Chavez
(the wife of Don Mariano), as is told, crossed the river
from the village of Padillas, the place of their residence,
and administered comforts to the unfortunate band of
Texans.<a name="FNanchor_142_143" id="FNanchor_142_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_143" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Though the murder of young Chavez was
evidently not sanctioned by the Texans generally, it will,
notwithstanding, have greatly embittered this powerful
family against them—a family whose liberal principles
could not otherwise have been very unfavorable to Texas.<a name="FNanchor_143_144" id="FNanchor_143_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_144" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The attack upon the village of Mora, though of less
important results, was nevertheless an unpropitiatory movement.
The inhabitants of that place are generally very
simple and innocent rancheros and hunters, and, being
separated by the snowy mountains from the principal
settlements of New Mexico, their hearts seem ever to have
been inclined to the Texans. In fact, the village having
been founded by some American denizens, the Mexican
inhabitants appear in some degree to have imitated their
character.</p>

<p>The defeat of Armijo's vanguard was attended by still
more disastrous consequences, both to the American and
Texan interest. That division was composed of the militia
of {173} the North—from about Taos—many of them
Taos Pueblos. These people had not only remained <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg233"></a>[p233]</span>
embittered against Gov. Armijo since the revolution of 1837,
but had always been notably in favor of Texas. So loth
were they to fight the Texans, that, as I have been assured,
the governor found it necessary to bind a number of them
upon their horses, to prevent their escape, till he got them
fairly upon the Prairies. And yet the poor fellows were
compelled to suffer the vengeance which was due to their
guilty general!</p>

<p>When the news of their defeat reached Taos, the friends
and relatives of the slain—the whole population indeed,
were incensed beyond measure; and two or three, naturalized
foreigners who were supposed to favor the cause of
Texas, and who were in good standing before, were now
compelled to flee for their lives; leaving their houses and
property a prey to the incensed rabble. Such appears to
have been the reaction of public sentiment resulting from
the catastrophe upon the Prairies!</p>

<p>Had the Texans proceeded differently—had they induced
the Mexicans to surrender without battle, which
they might no doubt easily have accomplished, they could
have secured their services, without question, as guides to
Gen. Armijo's camp, and that unmitigated tyrant might
himself have fallen into their hands. The difficulty of
maintaining order among the Texans was perhaps the
cause of many of their unfortunate proceedings. {174}
And no information of the caravan having been obtained,
a detachment of seventy or eighty men left, to return to
Texas.</p>

<p>The traders arrived soon after, escorted by about two
hundred U. S. Dragoons under the command of Capt.
Cook.<a name="FNanchor_144_145" id="FNanchor_144_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_145" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Col. Snively with a hundred men being then
encamped on the south side of the Arkansas river, some
ten to fifteen miles below the point called the 'Caches,' <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg234"></a>[p234]</span>
he crossed the river and met Capt. Cook, who soon made
known his intention of disarming him and his companions,—an
intention which he at once proceeded to put into
execution. A portion of the Texans, however, deceived the
American captain in this wise. Having concealed their
own rifles, which were mostly Colt's repeaters, they delivered
to Capt. Cook the worthless fusils they had taken
from the Mexicans; so that, when they were afterwards
released, they still had their own valuable arms; of which,
however, so far as the caravan in question was concerned,
they appear to have had no opportunity of availing themselves.</p>

<p>These facts are mentioned merely as they are said to
have occurred. Capt. Cook has been much abused by
the Texans, and accused of having violated a friendly flag—of
having taken Col. Snively prisoner while on a friendly
visit. This is denied by Capt. Cook, and by other persons
who were in company at the time. But apart from the
means employed by the American commander (the propriety
or impropriety of which I shall not attempt {175} to
discuss), the act was evidently the salvation of the Santa
Fé caravan, of which a considerable portion were Americans.
Had he left the Texans with their arms, he would doubtless
have been accused by the traders of escorting them to the
threshold of danger, and then delivering them over to
certain destruction, when he had it in his power to secure
their safety.</p>

<p>Capt. Cook with his command soon after returned to
the United States,<a name="FNanchor_145_146" id="FNanchor_145_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_146" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and with him some forty of the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg235"></a>[p235]</span>
disarmed Texans, many of whom have been represented
as gentlemen worthy of a better destiny. A large portion
of the Texans steered directly home from the Arkansas
river; while from sixty to seventy men, who elected Warfield
their commander, were organized for the pursuit and
capture of the caravan, which had already passed on some
days in advance towards Santa Fé. They pursued in the
wake of the traders, it is said, as far as the Point of Rocks
(twenty miles east of the crossing of the Colorado or Canadian),
but made no attempt upon them<a name="FNanchor_146_147" id="FNanchor_146_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_147" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>—whence they
returned direct to Texas. Thus terminated the 'Second
Texan Santa Fé Expedition,' as it has been styled; and
{176} though not so disastrous as the first, it turned out
nearly as unprofitable.</p>

<p>Although this expedition was composed wholly of Texans,
or persons not claiming to be citizens of the United States,
and organized entirely in Texas—and, notwithstanding
the active measures adopted by the United States government
to defend the caravans, as well of Mexicans as of Americans,
against their enemy—Señor Bocanegra, Mexican Minister
of Foreign Relations, made a formal demand upon the
United States (as will be remembered), for damages resulting
from this invasion. In a rejoinder to Gen. Thompson
(alluding to Snively's company), he says, that "Independence,
in Missouri, was the starting point of these men."
The preceding narrative will show the error under which
the honorable secretary labored.<a name="FNanchor_147_148" id="FNanchor_147_148"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_147_148" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg236"></a>[p236]</span></p>

<p> A portion of the party who killed Chavez was from the
frontier of Missouri; but witness the active exertions on
the border to bring these depredators to justice—and
then let the contrast be noted betwixt this affair and the
impunity with which robberies are every day committed
throughout Mexico, where well-known highwaymen often
run at large, unmolested either by the citizens or by the
authorities. What would Señor Bocanegra say if every
other government were to demand indemnity for all the
robberies committed upon their citizens in Mexico?</p>

<p>But the most unfortunate circumstance attending this
invasion of the Prairies—unfortunate {177} at least to the
United States and to New Mexico—was the closing of
the Northern ports to foreign commerce, which was doubtless,
to a great degree, a consequence of the before-mentioned
expedition, and which of course terminated the
Santa Fé Trade, at least for the present.<a name="FNanchor_148_149" id="FNanchor_148_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_149" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>I am of the impression, however, that little apprehension
need be entertained, that this decree of Gen. Santa Anna
will be permitted much longer to continue,<a name="FNanchor_149_150"
id="FNanchor_149_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_150" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
unless our
peaceful relations with Mexico should be disturbed; an
event, under any circumstances, seriously to be deprecated.
With the continuation of peace between us, the Mexicans
will certainly be compelled to open their northern frontier <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg237"></a>[p237]</span>
ports, to avoid a revolution in New Mexico, with which
they are continually threatened while this embargo continues.
Should the obnoxious decree be repealed, the
Santa Fé Trade will doubtless be prosecuted again with
renewed vigor and enterprise.</p>

Some general statistics of the Santa Fé Trade may prove not wholly without
interest to the mercantile reader. With this view, I have prepared the following
table of the probable amounts of merchandise invested in the Santa Fé Trade, from
1822 to 1843 inclusive, and about the portion of the same transferred to the Southern
markets (chiefly Chihuahua) during the same period; together with the approximate
number of wagons, men and proprietors engaged each year.</p>

<p>The foregoing table is not given as perfectly accurate, yet it is believed to be
about as nearly so as any that could be made out at the present day. The column
marked "Pro's." (Proprietors), though even less precise than the other statistics, presents,
I think, about the proportion of the whole number engaged each year who
were owners. At first, as will be seen, almost every individual of each caravan was
a proprietor, while of late the capital has been held by comparatively few hands.
In 1843, the greater portion of the traders were New Mexicans, several of whom,
during the three years previous, had embarked in this trade, of which they bid fair
to secure a monopoly.</p>

<p>The amount of merchandise transported to Santa Fé each year, is set down at
its probable cost in the Eastern cities of the United States. Besides freights and
insurance to Independence, there has been an annual investment, averaging nearly
twenty-five per cent. upon the cost of the stocks, in wagons, teams, provisions, hire
of hands, &#38;c., for transportation across the Prairies. A large portion of this
remaining unconsumed, however, the ultimate loss on the outfit has not been more
than half of the above amount. Instead of purchasing outfit, some traders prefer
employing freighters, a number of whom are usually to be found on the frontier of
Missouri, ready to transport goods to Santa Fé, at ten to twelve cents per pound.
From thence to Chihuahua the price of freights is six to eight cents—upon mules,
or in wagons.
</p>
<p>
The average gross returns of the traders has rarely exceeded fifty per cent. upon
the cost of their merchandise, leaving a net profit of between twenty and forty per
cent.; though their profits have not unfrequently been under ten per cent.: in fact,
as has before been mentioned, their adventures have sometimes been losing
speculations.<a name="FNanchor_A_137" id="FNanchor_A_137"></a><a

that a portion of the preceding table corresponds substantially with one presented on page
318 of that work. In justice to myself, I feel compelled to state, that, in 1841, I published,
in the Galveston "Daily Advertiser," a table of the Santa Fé trade from 1831 to
1840 inclusive, of which that of Mr. Mayer embraces an exact copy. I have since made
additions, and corrected it to some extent, but still the correspondence is such as seemed
to require of me this explanation.</p></div>

<a href="#FNanchor_137_138"><span class="label">[137]</span></a>
With a view to encourage adventurers, the government of Chihuahua agreed
to reduce the impost duties to a very low rate, in favor of a pioneer enterprise; and
to furnish an escort of dragoons for the protection of the traders.
</p>
<p>
The expedition was undertaken chiefly by Mexicans; but one American merchant,
Dr. H. Connelly, having invested capital in it. I obtained from this intelligent
gentleman a very interesting sketch of the adventures of this pioneer party,
which I regret that my plan will not permit me to present in detail.
</p>
<p>
The adventurers set out from Chihuahua on the 3d of April, 1839, amidst the
benisons of the citizens, and with the confident hope of transferring the valuable
trade of the North to their city. The caravan (including fifty dragoons), consisted
of over a hundred men, yet only about half a dozen of the number were proprietors.
Though they had but seven wagons, they brought about seven hundred mules, and
two or three hundred thousand dollars in specie and bullion, for the purposes of
their adventure.
</p>
<p>
They took the Presidio del Norte in their route, and then proceeding northwestwardly,
finally arrived at Fort Towson after a protracted journey of three months;
but without meeting with any hostile savages, or encountering any serious casualty,
except getting bewildered, after crossing Red River, which they mistook for the
Brazos. This caused them to shape their course thence nearly north, in search of
the former stream, until they reached the Canadian river, where they met with
some Delaware Indians, of whom they obtained the first correct information of their
whereabouts; and by whom they were piloted safely to Fort Towson.
</p>
<p>
It had been the intention of these adventurers to return to Chihuahua the ensuing
fall; but from various accidents and delays, they were unable to get ready until the
season had too far advanced; which, with an incessant series of rains that followed,
prevented them from travelling till the ensuing spring. Learning that the Texans
were friendly disposed towards them, they now turned their course through the
midst of the northern settlements of that republic. Of the kind treatment they
experienced during their transit, Dr. Connelly speaks in the following terms: "I
have never been more hospitably treated, or had more efficient assistance, than was
given by the citizens of Red River. All seemed to vie with each other in rendering
us every aid in their power; and our Mexican friends, notwithstanding the hostile
attitude in which the two countries stood towards each other, were treated with a
kindness which they still recollect with the warmest feelings of gratitude." This
forms a very notable contrast with the treatment which the Texan traders, who
afterwards visited Santa Fé, received at the hands of the Mexicans.
</p>
<p>
The Caravan now consisted of sixty or seventy wagons laden with merchandise,
and about two hundred and twenty-five men, including their escort of Mexican
dragoons. They passed the Texan border early in April, and expected to intersect
their former track beyond the Cross Timbers, but that trail having been partially
obliterated, they crossed it unobserved, and were several days lost on the waters
of the Brazos river. Having turned their course south for a few days, however,
they fortunately discovered their old route at a branch of the Colorado.
</p>
<p>
After this they continued their journey without further casualty; for notwithstanding
they met with a large body of Comanches, they passed them amicably, and
soon reached the Rio Pecos. Though very narrow, this stream was too deep to be
forded, and they were compelled to resort to an expedient characteristic of the
Prairies. There being not a stick of timber anywhere to be found, of which to make
even a raft, they buoyed up a wagon-body by binding several empty water-kegs to
the bottom, which served them the purpose of a ferry-boat.
</p>
<p>
When they reached Presidio del Norte again, they learned that Gov. Irigóyen,
with whom they had celebrated the contract for a diminution of their duties, had
died during their absence. A new corps of officers being in power, they were now
threatened with a charge of full tariff duties. After a delay of forty-five days at the
Presidio, however, they made a compromise, and entered Chihuahua on the 27th
of August, 1840.
</p>
<p>
The delays and accumulated expenses of this expedition caused it to result so
disastrously to the interests of all who were engaged in it, that no other enterprise
of the kind has since been undertaken.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span></p></div>

<p>While I have endeavored in the preceding pages to
give the reader some general idea of life upon the Prairies,
I feel that I have wholly failed thus far to convey any
adequate notions of their natural history. I propose in
the following pages to repair this deficiency as far as I am
able, and to present a rapid sketch of the vastness of those
mighty territories; of their physical geography; and of the
life, as well vegetable as animal, which they sustain. It
is to be regretted that this ample field for observation
should have received so little of the consideration of scientific
men; for there {179} is scarcely a province in the whole
wide range of Nature's unexplored domains, which is so
worthy of study, and yet has been so little studied by the
natural philosopher.</p>

<p>If we look at the Great Western Prairies, independently
of the political powers to which portions of them respectively
belong, we shall find them occupying the whole of that <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg238"></a>[p238]</span>
extensive territory lying between the spurs of the Rocky
Mountains on the north, and the rivers of Texas on the
south—a distance of some seven or eight hundred miles
in one direction; and from the frontiers of Missouri and
Arkansas on the east to the eastern branches of the southern
Rocky Mountains on the west—about six hundred miles
in the transverse direction: the whole comprising an area
of about 400,000 square miles, some 30,000 of which are
within the original limits of Texas, and 70,000 in those of
New Mexico (if we extend them east to the United States
boundary), leaving about 300,000 in the territory of the
United States.</p>

<p>This vast territory is not interrupted by any important
mountainous elevations, except along the borders of the
great western sierras, and by some low, craggy ridges about
the Arkansas frontier—skirts of the Ozark mountains.
There is, it is true, high on the dividing ridge between
Red River and the False Washita, a range of hills,
the southwestern portion of which extends about to
the 100th degree of longitude west from Greenwich; that
is, to the United States {180} boundary line. These are
generally called the Witchita mountains, but sometimes
<dfn>Towyash</dfn> by hunters, perhaps from <dfn>tóyavist</dfn>, the Comanche
word for mountain. I inquired once of a Comanche
Indian how his nation designated this range of mountains,
which was then in sight of us. He answered, "<i>Tóyavist</i>."
"But this simply means a mountain," I replied. "How do
you distinguish this from any other mountain?" "There
are no other mountains in the Comanche territory," he
rejoined—"none till we go east to your country, or south
to Texas, or west to the land of the Mexican."</p>

<p>With these exceptions, there are scarcely any elevations
throughout these immense plains which should be dignified
by the title of mountains. Those seen by the Texan Santa <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg239"></a>[p239]</span>
Fé Expedition about the sources of Red River, were without
doubt the <dfn>cejas</dfn> or brows of the elevated table plains with
which the Prairies abound, and which, when viewed from
the plain below, often assume the appearance of formidable
mountains; but once upon their summit, the spectator sees
another vast plain before him.</p>

<p>These <i>table lands</i>, or <dfn>mesas</dfn>, as the Mexicans term them,
of which there are many thousands of square miles lying
between the frontier of the United States and the Rocky
Mountains, are level plains, elevated a considerable distance
above the surrounding country, and may be likened to
the famous steppes of Asia. They are cut up with numerous
{181} streams, the largest of which are generally bordered
for several miles back by hilly uplands, which are
for the most part sandy, dry and barren.</p>

<p>The most notable of the great <i>plateaux</i> of the Prairies
is that known to Mexicans as <i>El Llano Estacado</i>, which
is bounded on the north by the Canadian river—extends
east about to the United States boundary, including the
heads of the False Washita and other branches of Red
River—and spreads southward to the sources of Trinity,
Brazos and Colorado rivers, and westward to Rio Pecos.
It is quite an elevated and generally a level plain, without
important hills or ridges, unless we distinguish as such
the craggy breaks of the streams which border and pierce
it. It embraces an area of about 30,000 square miles,
most of which is without water during three-fourths of the
year; while a large proportion of its few perennial streams
are too brackish to drink of.</p>

<p>I have been assured by Mexican hunters and Indians,
that, from Santa Fé southeastward, there is but one route
upon which this plain can be safely traversed during the
dry season; and even some of the watering-places on this
are at intervals of fifty to eighty miles, and hard to find. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg240"></a>[p240]</span>
Hence the Mexican traders and hunters, that they might
not lose their way and perish from thirst, once staked out
this route across the plain, it is said; whence it has received
the name of <dfn>El Llano Estacado</dfn>, or the Staked Plain.</p>

<p>{182} In some places the brows of these <i>mesas</i> approach
the very borders of the streams. When this occurs on
both sides, it leaves deep chasms or ravines between, called
by the Mexicans <dfn>cañones</dfn>, and which abound in the vicinity
of the mountains. The Canadian river flows through one
of the most remarkable of these cañones for a distance of
more than fifty miles—extending from the road of the
Missouri caravans downward—throughout the whole extent
of which the gorge is utterly impassable for wagons,
and almost so for animals.</p>

<p>Intersecting the direct route from Missouri, this cañon
was a source of great annoyance to some of the pioneers in
the Santa Fé trade. In 1825, a caravan with a number
of wagons reached it about five miles below the present
ford. The party was carelessly moving along, without
suspecting even a ravine at hand, as the bordering plains
were exceedingly level, and the opposite margins of equal
height, when suddenly they found themselves upon the
very brink of an immense precipice, several hundred
yards deep, and almost perpendicular on both sides of
the river. At the bottom of those cliffs, there was, as is
usually the case, a very narrow but fertile valley, through
which the river wound its way, sometimes touching the
one bluff and sometimes the other.</p>

<p>Ignorant of a ford so near above, the caravan turned
down towards the crossing of the former traders. "We
travelled fifty miles," {183} says Mr. Stanley, who was
of the caravan, "the whole of which distance the river is
bound in by cliffs several hundred feet high, in many places
nearly perpendicular. We at length came to the termination
of the table land; but what scene presented itself! <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg241"></a>[p241]</span>
The valley below could only be reached by descending a
frightful cliff of from 1200 to 1500 feet, and more or less
precipitous. After a search of several hours, a practicable
way was found; and, with the greatest fatigue and exertion,
by locking wheels, holding on with ropes, and literally
lifting the wagons down in places, we finally succeeded
in reaching the bottom.... How did the Canadian and
other streams in New Mexico sink themselves to such
immense depths in the solid rock? It seems impossible
that the water should have worn away the rock while as
hard as in its present state. What a field of speculation
for the geologist, in the propositions—Were the chasms
made for the streams, or did the streams make the chasms?
Are they not of volcanic origin?"</p>

<p>Nor are the flat prairies always free from this kind of
annoyance to travellers. They are not unfrequently intersected
by diminutive chasms or water-cuts, which, though
sometimes hardly a rod in width, are often from fifty to
a hundred feet deep. These little cañones are washed
out by the rains, in their descent to the bordering streams,
which is soon effected after an opening is once made through
the surface; for though the clayey {184} foundation is
exceedingly firm and hard while dry, it seems the most
soluble of earths, and melts almost as rapidly as snow
under the action of water. The tenacious turf of the
'buffalo grass,' however, retains the marginal surface,
so that the sides are usually perpendicular—indeed,
often shelving inward at the base, and therefore utterly
impassable. I have come unsuspectingly upon the verge
of such a chasm; and though, to a stranger, the appearance
would indicate the very head of the ravine, I would sometimes
be compelled to follow its meandering course for
miles without being able to double its 'breaks.' These
I have more especially observed high on the borders of the
Canadian. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg242"></a>[p242]</span></p>

<p>The geological constitution of the Prairies is exceedingly
diversified. Along the eastern border, especially towards
the north, there is an abundance of limestone, interspersed
with sandstone, slate, and many extensive beds of bituminous
coal. The coal is particularly abundant in some
of the regions bordering the Neosho river; where there
are also said to be a few singular bituminous or 'tar springs,'
as they are sometimes called by the hunters. There are
also many other mineral, and particularly sulphur springs,
to be met with.</p>

<p>Further westward, the sandstone prevails; but some of
the table plains are based upon strata of a sort of friable
calcareous rock, which has been denominated 'rotten limestone:'
yet along the borders of the mountains the base of
the plains seems generally {185} to be of trap and greenstone.
From the waters of Red River to the southwest
corner of Missouri, throughout the range of the Ozark
mountains, granite, limestone, flint and sandstone prevail.
But much of the middle portion of the Prairies is without
any apparent rocky foundation—we sometimes travel
for days in succession without seeing even as much as a
pebble.</p>

<p>On passing towards Santa Fé in 1839, and returning
in 1840, I observed an immense range of plaster of Paris,
both north and south of the Canadian river, and between
thirty and fifty miles east of the United States western
boundary. The whole country seemed based upon this
fossil, and cliffs and huge masses of it were seen in every
direction. It ranges from the coarsest compact sulphate
of lime or ordinary plaster, to the most transparent gypsum
or selenite, of which last there is a great abundance. By
authentic accounts from other travellers, this range of
gypsum extends, in a direction nearly north, almost to the
Arkansas river. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg243"></a>[p243]</span></p>

<p>Of metallic minerals, iron, lead, and perhaps copper, are
found on the borders of the Prairies; and it is asserted
that several specimens of silver ores have been met with
on our frontier, as well as about the Witchita and the Rocky
Mountains. Gold has also been found, no doubt, in different
places; yet it is questionable whether it has anywhere
been discovered in sufficient abundance to render it worth
the seeking. Some trappers have reported {186} an extensive
gold region about the sources of the Platte river;
yet, although recent search has been made, it has not been
discovered.<a name="FNanchor_150_151" id="FNanchor_150_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_151" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The most valuable perhaps, and the most abundant
mineral production of the Prairies is <i>Salt</i>. In the Choctaw
country, on the waters of Red River, there are two salt-works
in operation; and in the Cherokee nation salt springs
are numerous, three or four of which are now worked on
a small scale; yet a sufficient quantity of salt might easily
be produced to supply even the adjoining States. The
<i>Grand Saline</i>, about forty miles above Fort Gibson, near
the Neosho river, was considered a curiosity of its kind,
before its natural beauties were effaced by 'improvements.'<a name="FNanchor_151_152" id="FNanchor_151_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_152" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
In the border of a little valley, a number of small salt springs
break out, around the orifice of each of which was formed,
in the shape of a pot, a kind of calcareous saline concretion.
None of the springs are very bold, but the water is strong,
and sufficiently abundant for extensive works.</p>

<p>There have been several <dfn>Salines</dfn>, or mines (if we may
so term them) of pure salt, discovered in different parts
of the Prairies. The most northern I have heard of, is <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg244"></a>[p244]</span>
fifty or sixty miles west of the Missouri river, and thirty
or forty south of the Platte, near a tributary called the
Saline; where the Otoes and other Indians procure salt.
It is described as resembling the <i>salinas</i> of New Mexico,
and the quantity of salt as inexhaustible. South of the
Arkansas river and a degree or two further {187} westward,
there are several of these salines, which are perhaps still
more extensive.</p>

<p>I have been favored with some extracts from the journal
of Capt. Nathan Boone<a name="FNanchor_152_153" id="FNanchor_152_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_153" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> of the United States' Dragoons,
who made an exploring tour through those desolate regions
during the summer of 1843. In his journey, between
the Canadian and Upper Arkansas, he found efflorescent
salt in many places, as well as a superabundance of strongly
impregnated salt-water; but, besides these, he visited
two considerable salines.</p>

<p>Of the first, which he calls the 'Salt Plain,' he remarks,
that "the approach was very gratifying, and from the
appearance one might expect to find salt in a solid mass,
for the whole extent of the plain, of several feet in thickness."
This is situated in the forks of the Salt Fork of
the Arkansas. The plain is described as being level as a
floor, and evidently sometimes overflowed by the streams
which border it. Yet the extent of salt, it would seem,
did not realize Capt. Boone's anticipations, as he remarks
that it was covered "with the slightest possible
film of crystallized salt on the surface, enough to make
it white." But he explored only a small portion of the
plain, which was very extensive.
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg245"></a>[p245]</span></p>

<p> However, the most wonderful saline is the great <i>Salt
Rock</i>, which he found further to the {188} southwestward,
on the main Red Fork. "The whole cove on the right
of the two forks of the river," says Capt. Boone, "appears
to be one immense salt spring of water so much concentrated,
that, as soon as it reaches the point of breaking
forth, it begins depositing its salt. In this way a large
crust, or rock is formed all over the bottom for perhaps
160 acres. Digging through the sand for a few inches
anywhere in this space, we could find the solid salt, so
hard that there was no means in our power of getting up
a block of it. We broke our mattock in the attempt. In
many places, through this rock-salt crust the water boiled
up as clear as crystal ... but so salt that our hands,
after being immersed in it and suffered to dry, became as
white as snow. Thrusting the arm down into these holes,
they appeared to be walled with salt as far down as one
could reach. The cliffs which overhang this place are
composed of red clay and gypsum, and capped with a
stratum of the latter.... We found this salt a little
bitter from the impurities it contained, probably Epsom
salts principally." As it is overhung with sulphate of lime,
and perhaps also based upon the same, might not this
'salt-rock' be heavily impregnated with this mineral, occasioning
its excessive hardness? Capt. Boone also speaks
of gypsum in various other places, both north and south
of this, during his travel.</p>

<p>Mr. Sibley (then of Fort Osage), who was quite familiar
with the western prairies, visited {189} a saline, over thirty
years ago, which would seem to be the 'Salt Plain' first
mentioned by Capt. Boone. The former, it is true, found
the salt much more abundant than as described by the
latter; but this may be owing to Capt. Boone's not having <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg246"></a>[p246]</span>
penetrated as far as the point alluded to by Mr. Sibley,—whose
description is in the following language:<a name="FNanchor_153_154" id="FNanchor_153_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_154" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>"The Grand Saline is situated about 280 miles southwest
of Fort Osage, between two forks of a small branch
of the Arkansas, one of which washes its southern extremity,
and the other, the principal one, runs nearly parallel,
within a mile of its opposite side. It is a hard level
plain of reddish colored sand, and of an irregular or mixed
figure. Its greatest length is from northwest to southeast,
and its circumference about thirty miles. From the appearance
of the driftwood that is scattered over, it would
seem the whole plain is at times inundated by the overflowing
of the streams that pass near it. This plain is
entirely covered in dry hot weather, from two to six inches
deep, with a crust of beautiful clean white salt, of a quality
rather superior to the imported blown salt. It bears a
striking resemblance to a field of brilliant snow after a
rain, with a light crust on its top."</p>

<p>This is, in extent and appearance, nearly as described
by several hunters and Indian traders with whom I have
conversed. Col. Logan, a worthy former agent of the
Creek Indians,<a name="FNanchor_154_155" id="FNanchor_154_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_155" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> {190} visited no doubt the same, not far
from the same period; and he describes it in a similar manner—only
representing the depth of the salt as greater.
Everywhere that he dug through the stratum of earth about
the margin, at the depth of a few inches he came to a <i>rock
of solid salt</i>, which induced him to believe that the whole
country thereabouts was based upon a stratum of 'rock salt.' <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg247"></a>[p247]</span>
This was of a reddish cast, partaking of the color of the surface
of the surrounding country. Mr. Sibley remarks that
"the distance to a navigable branch of Arkansas is about
eighty miles"—referring perhaps to the Red Fork; though
the saline is no doubt at a still less distance from the main
stream.</p>

<p>With such inexhaustible mines of salt within two or
three days' journey of the Arkansas river, and again within
the same distance of the Missouri, which would cost no
further labor than the digging it up and the transporting
of it to boats for freighting it down those streams, it seems
strange that they should lie idle, while we are receiving
much of our supplies of this indispensable commodity from
abroad.</p>

<p>Besides the <i>salines</i> already mentioned, there is one high
on the Canadian river, some two hundred miles east of
Santa Fé. Also, it is said, there are some to be found on
the waters of Red River; and numerous others are no
doubt scattered throughout the same regions, which have
never been discovered.</p>

<p>Many of the low valleys of all the western {191} streams
(Red River as well as Arkansas and its branches), are
impregnated with salinous qualities, and, during wet
weather, ooze saltish exudations, which effloresce in a thin
scum. This is sometimes pure salt, but more frequently
compounded of different salts—not only of the muriate,
but of the sulphate of soda, and perhaps magnesia; often
strongly tinctured with nitre. Some of the waters of these
sections (particularly when stagnant) are so saturated
with this compound during dry weather, that they are
insupportable even for brutes—much to the consternation
of a forlorn traveller. In these saline flats nothing
grows but hard wiry grass, which a famished beast will
scarcely eat. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg248"></a>[p248]</span></p>

<p>It is from these exudations, as well as from the salines
or salt plains before mentioned, that our western waters,
especially from Arkansas to Red River, acquire their
brackishness during the low seasons; and not from the
mountains, as some have presumed. Such as issue from
thence are there as pure, fresh and crystalline as snow-fed
rills and icy fountains can make them.</p>

<p>It will now readily be inferred that the Great Prairies
from Red River to the western sources of the Missouri,
are, as has before been intimated, chiefly uninhabitable—not
so much for want of wood (though the plains are altogether
naked), as of soil and of water; for though some
of the plains appear of sufficiently fertile soil, they are
mostly of a sterile character, and all too dry to be cultivated.
{192} These great steppes seem only fitted for the
haunts of the mustang, the buffalo, the antelope, and their
migratory lord, the prairie Indian. Unless with the
progressive influence of time, some favorable mutation
should be wrought in nature's operations, to revive the
plains and upland prairies, the occasional fertile valleys
are too isolated and remote to become the abodes of
civilized man.</p>

<p>Like the table plains of Northern Mexico, these high
prairies could at present only be made available for grazing
purposes, and that in the vicinity of the water-courses.
The grass with which they are mostly clothed, is of a superior
quality. The celebrated 'buffalo grass' is of two kinds,
both of which are species of the <dfn>grama</dfn> of New Mexico,
and equally nutritious at all seasons. It is the same, I
believe, that is called 'mezquite grass' in Texas, from the
mezquite tree which grows there in the same dry regions
with it. Of this unequalled pasturage the great western
prairies afford a sufficiency to graze cattle for the supply
of all the United States. It is particularly adapted to <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg249"></a>[p249]</span>
sheep-raising, as is shown by example of the same species
in New Mexico.</p>

<p>But from the general sterility and unhabitableness of
the Prairies is excepted, as will be understood, that portion,
already alluded to, which borders our western frontier.
The uplands from the Arkansas boundary to the Cross
Timbers, are everywhere beautifully interspersed with
isolated prairies and glades, many of which are fertile,
though some are {193} too flat, and consequently inclined
to be marshy. The valleys of the streams are principally
of a rich loam, rather subject to inundations, but mostly
tillable. The timbered uplands are mostly of fair quality,
except on the broken ridges and mountainous sections
before referred to. Some of the uplands, however, known
usually as 'post-oak flats,' like the marshy prairies, seem
to be based upon quick-sand. The soil is of a dead unproductive
character, and covered with small lumps or mounds
of various sizes, and of irregular shapes.</p>

<p>The country lying west of Missouri, which includes
the sources of the Neosho, the Verdigris, the Marais-des-Cygnes
and other branches of the Osage, and the lower
sections of the Kansas river, vies with any portion of the
Far West in the amenity of its upland prairies—in the
richness of its alluvial bottoms—in the beauty and freshness
of its purling rills and rivulets—and in the salubrity
of its atmosphere.</p>

<p>We have here then, along the whole border, a strip of
country, averaging at least two hundred miles wide by
five hundred long—and even more if we extend it up the
Missouri river—affording territory for two States, respectable
in size, and though more scant in timber, yet more
fertile, in general, than the two conterminous States of
Missouri and Arkansas. But most of this delightful region
has been ceded to the different tribes of the Frontier Indians. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg250"></a>[p250]</span></p>

<p>{194} Concerning that portion of the Prairies which
lies south of Red River, in Northern Texas, I learn from
some interesting memoranda, politely furnished me by
Dr. Henry Connelly, one of the principals of the pioneer
expedition from Chihuahua to Arkansas, of which I have
already spoken, that, besides some beautiful lands among
the Cross Timbers, there is a great deal of delightful country
still further west, of a part of which that gentleman
holds the following language:—"Between the Brazos and
Red River, there is surely the most beautiful and picturesque
region I have ever beheld. I saw some of the finest timber,
generally oak—not that scrubby oak which characterizes
so much of the Texan territory—but large black and
bur-oak; such as would answer all the purposes for which
the largest timber is useful. Between those two rivers,
no doubt there is destined to be one of the most dense and
prosperous settlements. The fertility of the soil is not
exceeded by any I have seen; and, from the high and undulating
character of the country, there can be no doubt
of its being very healthy."</p>

<p>To the westward of Rio Brazos, and south of some
sandy and saline regions which border the upper portions
of this stream, the same enterprising traveller represents
many of the valleys as rich and beautiful, and the uplands
as being in many places sparsely timbered with mezquite
trees. This is particularly the case on the sources of the
Colorado, where the country is delightfully watered. But
immediately {195} north of this sets in that immense desert
region of the Llano Estacado.</p>

<p>The chief natural disadvantage to which the Great
Western Prairies are exposed, consists in the absence of
navigable streams. Throughout the whole vast territory
which I have been attempting to describe, there is not a
single river, except the Missouri, which is navigable during <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg251"></a>[p251]</span>
the whole season. The remaining streams, in their course
through the plains, are and must continue to be, for all
purposes of commerce, comparatively useless.</p>

<p>The chief of these rivers are the Missouri, the Arkansas,
and Red River, with their numerous tributaries. The
principal western branches of the Missouri are the Yellow
Stone, the Platte and the Kansas. Small 'flats' and 'buffalo
boats' have passed down the two former for a considerable
distance, during high water; but they are never
navigable to any extent by steamboats.</p>

<p>The <i>Arkansas</i> river penetrates far into the Rocky Mountains,
its ramifications, interlocking with some of the waters
of the Missouri, Columbia, San Buenaventura, Colorado
of the West, and Rio del Norte.<a name="FNanchor_155_156" id="FNanchor_155_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_156" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The channel of this
stream, in its course through the Prairies, is very wide and
shallow, with banks in many places hardly five feet above
low water. It will probably measure nearly 2000 miles
in length, from its source to the frontier of Arkansas. It
is called <i>Rio Napeste</i> by the Mexicans; but among the
early French voyagers it acquired the name of <i>Arkansas</i>,
or rather {196} <i>Akansa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_156_157" id="FNanchor_156_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_157" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> from a tribe of the Dahcotah or
Osage stock, who lived near its mouth. This river has
numerous tributaries, some of which are of great length,
yet there is not one that is at all navigable, except the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg252"></a>[p252]</span>
Neosho from the north, which has been descended by small
boats for at least a hundred miles.</p>

<p><i>Red River</i> is much shorter and narrower from the frontier
westward than the Arkansas, bearing but little over half
the volume of water. Even in its serpentine course it can
hardly exceed 1200 miles from the Arkansas boundary to
its source. This river rises in the table plains of the Llano
Estacado, and has not, as I have been assured by traders
and hunters, any mountainous elevations about its source
of any consequence;<a name="FNanchor_157_158" id="FNanchor_157_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_158" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> although we are continually hearing
the inhabitants of its lower borders speak of the "<i>June
freshets</i> produced by the melting of the snow in the mountains."</p>

<p>The upper portions of this river, and emphatically from
the mouth of the False Washita (or Faux Ouachittâ) upward,
present little or no facilities for navigation; being
frequently spread out over sand-bars to the width of several
hundred yards. A very credible Indian trader, who had
been on Red River {197} some two hundred miles above
the False Washita, informed me, that, while in some places
he found it not over fifty yards wide, in others it was at least
five hundred. This and most other prairie streams have
commonly very low banks with remarkably shallow channels,
which, during droughts, sometimes go dry in their
transit through the sandy plains.<a name="FNanchor_158_159" id="FNanchor_158_159"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_158_159" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg253"></a>[p253]</span></p>

<p> It would be neither interesting nor profitable to present
to my readers a detailed account of all the tributaries of
the three principal rivers already mentioned. They may
be {198} found for the most part laid down, with their
bearings and relative magnitudes, upon the map which
accompanies this work. It is only necessary to say in
addition, that none of them can ever be availed of to any
considerable extent for purposes of navigation.</p>

<p>With regard to the productions of the soil of these regions,
the reader will probably have formed, in the main, a tolerably
correct idea already; nevertheless a few further specifications
may not be altogether unacceptable.</p>

<p>The timber of that portion of the United States territory
which is included between the Arkansas frontier and the
Cross Timbers, throughout the highlands, is mostly oak
of various kinds, of which black-jack and post-oak predominate,
as these, and especially the former, seem only
capable of withstanding the conflagrations to which they
are exposed, and therefore abound along the prairie borders.
The black-jack presents a blackened, scrubby appearance,
with harsh rugged branches—partly on account of being
so often scorched and crisped by the prairie fires. About
the streams we find an intermixture of elm, hackberry, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg254"></a>[p254]</span>
peccan (or pecan), ash, walnut, mulberry, cherry, persimmon,
cottonwood, sycamore, birch, etc., with varieties
of hickory, gum, dogwood, and the like. All of the foregoing,
except paccan, gum and dogwood, are also found
west of Missouri, where, although the uplands are almost
wholly prairie, the richest growths predominate in the
valleys.</p>

<p>{199} In many of the rich bottoms from the Canadian
to Red River, for a distance of one or two hundred miles
west of the frontier, is found the celebrated <dfn>bois-d'arc</dfn>
(literally, <i>bow-wood</i>), usually corrupted in pronunciation
to <i>bowdark</i>. It was so named by the French on account
of its peculiar fitness for <i>bows</i>. This tree is sometimes
found with a trunk two or three feet in diameter, but,
being much branched, it is rarely over forty or fifty feet
high. The leaves are large, and it bears a fruit a little
resembling the orange in general appearance, though
rougher and larger, being four or five inches in diameter;
but it is not used for food. The wood is of a beautiful
light orange color, and, though coarse, is susceptible of
polish. It is one of the hardest, firmest and most durable
of timbers, and is much used by wagon-makers and millwrights,
as well as by the wild Indians, who make bows
of the younger growths.<a name="FNanchor_159_160" id="FNanchor_159_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_160" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>On the Arkansas and especially its southern tributaries
as far west as the Verdigris, and up those of Red River
nearly to the False Washita, the bottoms are mostly covered
with cane. And scattered over all the south to about
the same distance westward, the sassafras abounds, which
grows here in every kind of soil and locality.</p>

<p>The celebrated <i>Cross Timbers</i>, of which frequent mention
has been made, extend from the Brazos, or perhaps from
the Colorado of Texas, across the sources of Trinity, traversing <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg255"></a>[p255]</span>
Red River above the False Washita, and thence {200}
west of north, to the Red Fork of Arkansas, if not further.
It is a rough hilly range of country, and, though not mountainous,
may perhaps be considered a prolongation of that
chain of low mountains which pass to the northward of
Bexar and Austin city in Texas.<a name="FNanchor_160_161" id="FNanchor_160_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_161" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The Cross Timbers vary in width from five to thirty
miles, and entirely cut off the communication betwixt the
interior prairies and those of the great plains. They may
be considered as the 'fringe' of the great prairies, being
a continuous brushy strip, composed of various kinds of
undergrowth; such as black-jacks, post-oaks, and in some
places hickory, elm, etc., intermixed with a very diminutive
dwarf oak, called by the hunters 'shin-oak.' Most of the
timber appears to be kept small by the continual inroads
of the 'burning prairies;' for, being killed almost annually,
it is constantly replaced by scions of undergrowth; so that
it becomes more and more dense every reproduction. In
some places, however, the oaks are of considerable size,
and able to withstand the conflagrations. The underwood
is so matted in many places with grape-vines, greenbriars,
etc., as to form almost impenetrable 'roughs,' which
serve as hiding-places for wild beasts, as well as wild Indians;
and would, in savage warfare, prove almost as formidable
as the hammocks of Florida.</p>

<p>South of the Canadian, a branch of these Cross Timbers
projects off westward, extending across this stream, and
up its course for 100 {201} miles or so, from whence, it
inclines northwest beyond the North Fork, and ultimately
ceases, no doubt, in the great sandy plains in that direction.
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg256"></a>[p256]</span></p>

<p> The region of the Cross Timbers is generally well-watered;
and is interspersed with romantic and fertile tracts. The
bottoms of the tributaries of Red River, even for some
distance west of the Cross Timbers (perhaps almost to
the U. S. boundary), are mostly very fertile, and timbered
with narrow stripes of elm, hackberry, walnut, hickory,
mulberry, bur-oak and other rich growths.</p>

<p>But further north, and west of the Cross Timbers, even
the streams are nearly naked. The Cimarron river for
more than a hundred miles is absolutely without timber;
and the Arkansas, for so large a stream, is remarkably
scant. The southern border, being protected from the
prairie fires by a chain of sand-hills, which extends for two
hundred miles along it, is not so bare as the northern bank;
though even here it is only skirted with occasional sparsely
set groves of cottonwood in the nooks and bends. It is
upon the abundance of islands which intersperse its channel,
that the greatest quantity of timber (though purely
cottonwood) is to be found; yet withal, there are stretches
of miles without a tree in view. The banks of the Canadian
are equally naked; and, having fewer islands, the river
appears still more barren. In fact, there is scarce anything
else but cottonwood, and that very sparsely scattered
{202} along the streams, throughout most of the far-western
prairies.</p>

<p>It is unquestionably the prairie conflagrations that keep
down the woody growth upon most of the western uplands.
The occasional skirts and fringes which have escaped their
rage, have been protected by the streams they border. Yet
may not the time come when these vast plains will be
covered with timber? It would seem that the prairie
region, long after the discovery of America, extended to
the very banks of the Mississippi. Father Marquette,
in a voyage down this river, in 1673, after passing below <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg257"></a>[p257]</span>
the mouth of the Ohio, remarks:—"The banks of the
river began to be covered with high trees, which hindered
us from observing the country as we had done all along;
but we judged from the bellowing of the oxen [buffalo] that
the meadows are very near."<a name="FNanchor_161_162" id="FNanchor_161_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_162" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>—Indeed, there are parts
of the southwest now thickly set with trees of good size,
that, within the remembrance of the oldest inhabitants,
were as naked as the prairie plains; and the appearance
of the timber in many other sections indicates that it has
grown up within less than a century. In fact, we are now
witnessing the encroachment of the timber upon the prairies,
wherever the devastating conflagrations have ceased their
ravages.</p>

<p>The high plains seem too dry and lifeless to produce
timber; yet might not the vicissitudes of nature operate a
change likewise upon the seasons? Why may we not suppose
{203} that the genial influences of civilization—that
extensive cultivation of the earth—might contribute to the
multiplication of showers, as it certainly does of fountains?
Or that the shady groves, as they advance upon the prairies,
may have some effect upon the seasons? At least, many
old settlers maintain that the droughts are becoming less
oppressive in the West. The people of New Mexico also
assure us that the rains have much increased of latter
years, a phenomenon which the vulgar superstitiously
attribute to the arrival of the Missouri traders. Then
may we not hope that these sterile regions might yet be
thus revived and fertilized, and their surface covered one
day by flourishing settlements to the Rocky Mountains?</p>

<p>With regard to fruits, the Prairies are of course not very
plentifully supplied. West of the border, however, for
nearly two hundred miles, they are covered, in many places, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg258"></a>[p258]</span>
with the wild strawberry; and the groves lining the streams
frequently abound in grapes, plums, persimmons, mulberries,
peccans, hackberries, and other 'sylvan luxuries.'
The high prairies beyond, however, are very bare of fruits.
The prickly pear may be found over most of the dry plains;
but this is neither very palatable nor wholesome, though
often eaten by travellers for want of other fruits. Upon
the branches of the Canadian, North Fork, and Cimarron,
there are, in places, considerable quantities of excellent
plums, grapes, choke-cherries, gooseberries, and
currants—of the {204} latter there are three kinds, black, red, and
white. About the ravines and marshy grounds (particularly
towards the east) there are different kinds of small
onions, with which the traveller may season his fresh meats.
On the plains, also, I have met with a species resembling
garlic in flavor.</p>

<p>But the flowers are among the most interesting products
of the frontier prairies. These gay meadows wear their
most fanciful piebald robes from the earliest spring till
divested of them by the hoary frosts of autumn. When
again winter has fled, but before the grassy green appears,
or other vegetation has ventured to peep above the earth,
they are bespeckled in many places with a species of <i>erythronium</i>,
a pretty lilaceous little flower, which springs
from the ground already developed, between a pair of
lanceolate leaves, and is soon after in full bloom.<a name="FNanchor_162_163" id="FNanchor_162_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_163" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> But
the floriferous region only extends about two hundred
miles beyond the border: the high plains are nearly as
destitute of flowers as they are of fruits.</p>

<p>The <i>climate</i> of most parts of the Prairies is no doubt
healthy in the extreme; for a purer atmosphere is hardly
to be found. But the cold rains of the 'wet season,' and
the colder snows of winter, with the annoying winds <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg259"></a>[p259]</span>
that prevail at nearly all times, often render it very unpleasant.
It can hardly be said, it is true, that the Prairies
have their regular 'dry and rainy seasons;' yet the summers
are often so droughty, that, unless some change should
{205} be effected in nature's functions, cultivators would
generally find it necessary, no doubt, to resort to irrigation.
That portion, however, which is conterminous with our
western border, and to the distance of nearly two hundred
miles westward, in every respect resembles the adjacent
States of Missouri and Arkansas in climate. The south
is a little disposed to chills and fevers; but the northern
portion is as healthy as the most salubrious uplands of
Missouri.</p>

A stranger would be led to suppose we were without a system of orthography,
from the fact of our so generally adopting the French spelling of Indian names,
whereby all sight is soon lost of the original. The French first corrupt them, and
we, by adapting our pronunciation to their orthography, at once transform them
into new names. Thus 'polite usage' has converted into <i>Arkan´sas</i> the plural
of the primitive <i>Arkansa</i> or <i>Arkonsah</i>; though an approximate, <i>Ar´kansaw</i>, is still
the current 'vulgar' pronunciation. <i>Osage</i> and a great many others have suffered

Missouri to Santa Fé, has become the most famous. Its water disappears in the
sand and reappears again, in so many places, that some travellers have contended
that it 'ebbs and flows' periodically. This is doubtless owing to the fact, that
the little current which may flow above the sand in the night, or in cloudy weather,
is kept dried up, in an unshaded channel, during the hot sunny days. But in some
places the sand is so porous that the water never flows above it, except during
freshets.
</p>
<p>
I was once greatly surprised upon encountering one of these sandy sections of the
river after a tremendous rain-storm. Our caravan was encamped at the 'Lower
Cimarron Spring:' and, a little after night-fall, a dismal, murky cloud was seen
gathering in the western horizon, which very soon came lowering upon us, driven
by a hurricane, and bringing with it one of those tremendous bursts of thunder
and lightning, and rain, which render the storms of the Prairies, like those of the
tropics, so terrible. Hail-stones, as large as turkeys' eggs, and torrents of rain
soon drenched the whole country; and so rapidly were the banks of the river
overflowed, that the most active exertions were requisite to prevent the mules that
were 'staked' in the valley from drowning. Next morning, after crossing the
neck of a bend, we were, at the distance of about three miles, upon the river-bank
again; when, to our astonishment, the wetted sand, and an occasional pool, fast
being absorbed, were the only vestiges of the recent flood—no water was flowing
there!
</p>
<p>
In these sandy stretches of the Cimarron, and other similar 'dry streams,'
travellers procure water by excavating basins in the channel, a few feet deep, into
which the water is filtrated from the saturated sand.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span></p></div>

<p>The zoology of the Prairies has probably attracted more
attention than any other feature of their natural history.
This has not arisen altogether from the peculiar interest
the animals of the Prairies possess; but they constitute
so considerable a portion of the society of the traveller
who journeys among them, that they get to hold somewhat
the same place in his estimation that his fellow-creatures
would occupy if he were in civilization. Indeed, the
animals are <i>par éminence</i> the communities of the Prairies.</p>

<p>By far the most noble of these, and therefore {207} the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg260"></a>[p260]</span>
best entitled to precedence in the brief notice I am able
to present of the animals of those regions, is the <dfn>mustang</dfn><a name="FNanchor_163_164" id="FNanchor_163_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_164" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
or wild horse of the Prairies. As he is descended from the
stock introduced into America by the first Spanish colonists,
he has no doubt a partial mixture of Arabian blood. Being
of domestic origin, he is found of various colors, and sometimes
of a beautiful piebald.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact in the economy of nature, that all
<em>wild</em> animals of the same species should have one uniform
color (with only occasional but uniform differences between
males and females); while that of the <em>domestic</em> animals,
whether quadruped or fowl, is more or less diversified.</p>

<p>The beauty of the mustang is proverbial. One in particular
has been celebrated by hunters, of which marvellous
stories are told. He has been represented as a medium-sized
stallion of perfect symmetry, milk-white, save a pair
of black ears—a natural 'pacer,' and so fleet, it has been
said, as to leave far behind every horse that had been tried
in pursuit of him, without breaking his 'pace.' But I
infer that this story is somewhat mythical, from the difficulty
which one finds in fixing the abiding place of its
equine hero. He is familiarly known, by common report,
all over the great Prairies. The trapper celebrates him
in the vicinity of the northern Rocky {208} Mountains;
the hunter, on the Arkansas, or in the midst of the Plains;
while others have him pacing at the rate of half a mile a
minute on the borders of Texas. It is hardly a matter
of surprise, then, that a creature of such an ubiquitary
existence should never have been caught.</p>

<p>The wild horses are generally well-formed, with trim and
clean limbs; still their elegance has been much exaggerated
by travellers, because they have seen them at large, abandoned <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg261"></a>[p261]</span>
to their wild and natural gaiety. Then, it is true, they
appear superb indeed; but when caught and tamed, they
generally dwindle down to ordinary ponies. Large droves
are very frequently seen upon the Prairies, sometimes of
hundreds together, gambolling and curvetting within a
short distance of the caravans. It is sometimes difficult
to keep them from dashing among the loose stock of the
traveller, which would be exceedingly dangerous; for, once
together, they are hard to separate again, particularly if
the number of mustangs is much the greatest. It is a
singular fact, that the gentlest wagon-horse (even though
quite fagged with travel), once among a drove of mustangs,
will often acquire in a few hours all the intractable wildness
of his untamed companions.</p>

<p>The mustang is sometimes taken by the cruel expedient
of 'creasing,' which consists in shooting him through the
upper <i>crease</i> of the neck, above the cervical vertebræ;
when, the ball cutting a principal nerve, he falls as suddenly
{209} as if shot in the brain, and remains senseless
for a few minutes, during which he is secured with a rope.
He soon recovers from the shock, however, and springs to
his feet, but finds himself deprived of his liberty. He is
easily tamed after this, and the wound heals without leaving
any physical injury. But 'creasing' is so nice an operation
that many are killed in the attempt. If the ball pass a
little too low, it fractures a vertebra and kills the poor
brute instantly.</p>

<p>But the most usual mode, among the Mexicans and
Indians, of taking the <dfn>mesteña</dfn> (as the former call these
animals), is with the lazo. They pursue them on fleet
horses, and great numbers are thus noosed and tamed.
The mustang has been taken in Texas in considerable
numbers by preparing a strong pen at some passway or
crossing of a river, into which they are frightened and
caught. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg262"></a>[p262]</span></p>

<p>Upon the plains, I once succeeded in separating a gay-looking
stallion from his herd of <i>mesteñas</i>, upon which he
immediately joined our <i>caballada</i>, and was directly lazoed
by a Mexican. As he curvetted at the end of the rope, or
would stop and gaze majestically at his subjecters, his
symmetrical proportions attracted the attention of all;
and our best jockeys at once valued him at five hundred
dollars. But it appeared that he had before been tamed,
for he soon submitted to the saddle, and in a few days
dwindled down to scarce a twenty-dollar hackney.</p>

<p>Prairie travellers have often been reduced {210} to the
necessity of eating the flesh of the mustang; and, when
young and tender, it has been accounted savory enough;
but, when of full age, it is said to be exceedingly rancid,
particularly when fat. They are sometimes hunted by
Mexicans for their oil, which is used by the curriers.</p>

<p>The <i>buffalo</i>, though making no pretensions to the elegance
and symmetry of the mustang, is by far the most important
animal of the Prairies to the traveller. It is sufficiently
well known that these animals bear but little resemblance
to the buffalo of India; but that they are a species of bison,
or <dfn>bos Americanus</dfn>, according to naturalists. They are
called <dfn>Cíbolos</dfn> by the Mexicans; and it would certainly
have prevented ambiguity, had they been distinguished
by some other name than buffalo with us.</p>

<p>Their dusky black color becomes much paler during
the season of long hair.<a name="FNanchor_164_165"
 id="FNanchor_164_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_165"
 class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The phenomenon of a white
buffalo has frequently been remarked upon the Prairies;
but as the white skin is said to have been used in the
mystic ceremonies of many of the northern tribes of
Indians, this probably created such a demand for them,
that they have become nearly extinct. Their unusual <span
 class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg263"></a>[p263]</span>
color has commonly been considered a <i>lusus naturæ</i>, yet
it is probable that they stand in about the same relation
to the black or brown buffalo that black sheep do to white
ones. The horns of {211} the buffalo are short and black,
and almost concealed under the frightfully shaggy frontlets
of long woolly hair that crown the foreheads of the bulls;
which, with the goat-like beard, and ill-shapen hump,
form the chief distinction between them and the domestic
cattle: in fact, they are so nearly of the same species that
they will breed together; though the offspring, like the
mule, is said to be unfruitful. Between the males and
females there is still a greater disproportion in size than
among the domestic cattle. A buffalo cow is about as
heavy as a common ox, while a large fat bull will weigh
perhaps double as much.</p>

<p>These are very gregarious animals. At some seasons,
however, the cows rather incline to keep to themselves;
at other times they are mostly seen in the centre of the
gang, while the bulls are scattered around, frequently to
a considerable distance, evidently guarding the cows and
calves. And on the outskirts of the buffalo range, we
are apt to meet with small gangs of bulls alone, a day or
two's travel distant, as though performing the office of
'piquet guards' for the main herds.</p>

<p>The flesh of the buffalo is, I think, as fine as any meat
I ever tasted: the old hunter will not admit that there is
anything equal to it. Much of its apparent savoriness,
however, results perhaps from our sharpened 'prairie
appetites,' and our being usually upon salt provisions
awhile before obtaining it. The {212} flesh is of coarser
texture than beef, more juicy, and the fat and lean better
distributed. This meat is also very easy of digestion,<a name="FNanchor_165_166" id="FNanchor_165_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_166" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg264"></a>[p264]</span>
possessing even aperient qualities. The circumstance that
bulls of all ages, if fat, make good beef, is a further proof
of the superiority of buffalo meat. These are generally
selected for consumption in the winter and early spring,
when the cows, unless barren, are apt to be poor; but during
most of the year, the latter are the fattest and tenderest
meat. Of these, the udder is held as hardly second to
the tongue in delicacy. But what the tail of the beaver
is to the trapper, the tongue of the buffalo is to the hunter.
Next to this are the 'marrow-bones,' the tender-loins, and
the hump-ribs. Instead of a gristly substance, as sometimes
stated, the hump is produced by a convex tier of
vertical ribs, which project from the spine, forming a gradual
curve over the shoulders: those of the middle being sometimes
nearly two feet in length. The 'veal' is rarely good,
being generally poor, owing to the scanty supply of milk
which their dams afford, and to their running so much
from hunters and wolves.</p>

<p>This animal furnishes almost the exclusive food of the
prairie Indians, as well as covering for their wigwams
and most of their clothing; also their bedding, ropes, bags
for their meat, &#38;c.; sinews for bow-strings, for sewing
moccasins, leggins, and the like; besides {213} sustenance
for the numerous travellers and trappers who range upon
their grazing regions. Were they only killed for food,
however, their natural increase would perhaps replenish
the loss: yet the continual and wanton slaughter of them
by travellers and hunters, and the still greater havoc
made among them by the Indians, not only for meat, but
often for the skins and tongues alone (for which they find
a ready market among their traders), are fast reducing
their numbers, and must ultimately effect their total annihilation
from the continent. It is believed that the annual <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg265"></a>[p265]</span>
'export' of <i>buffalo rugs</i><a name="FNanchor_166_167" id="FNanchor_166_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_167" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> from the Prairies and bordering
'buffalo range,' is about a hundred thousand: and the
number killed wantonly, or exclusively for meat, is no
doubt still greater, as the skins are fit to dress scarcely
half the year. The vast extent of the prairies upon which
they now pasture is no argument against the prospect of
their total extinction, when we take into consideration the
extent of country from which they have already disappeared;
for it is well known, that, within the recollection of our
oldest pioneers, they were nearly as abundant east of the
Mississippi as they now are upon the western prairies; and
from history we learn, that they once ranged to the Atlantic
coast. Even within thirty years, they were abundant
over much of the present States of Missouri and Arkansas;
yet they are now rarely seen within two hundred miles of
the frontier. Indeed, upon the high {214} plains they
have very sensibly decreased within the last ten years.
Nevertheless, the number of buffalo upon the Prairies is
still immense. But, as they incline to migrate <i>en masse</i>
from place to place, it sometimes happens, that, for several
days' travel together, not a single one is to be met with;
but, in other places, many thousands are often seen at one
view.</p>

<p>The Indians, as well as Mexicans, hunt the buffalo
mostly with the bow and arrows. For this purpose they
train their fleetest horses to run close beside him; and,
when near enough, with almost unerring aim, they pierce
him with their arrows, usually behind the short ribs, ranging
forward, which soon disables and brings him to the
ground. When an arrow has been ill-directed, or does
not enter deep enough, and even sometimes when it has
penetrated a vital part, but is needed to use again, the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg266"></a>[p266]</span>
hunter sometimes rides up and draws it out while the
animal is yet running. An athletic Indian will not unfrequently
discharge his darts with such force, that I have
seen them (30 inches long) wholly buried in the body of
a buffalo: and I have been assured by hunters that the
arrows, missing the bones, have been known to pass entirely
through the huge carcass and fall upon the ground.</p>

<p>The dexterity acquired by these wild hunters in shooting
the buffalo, is very surprising. On one occasion, upon
the prairies, a party of Witchita Indians were encamped
near us; and {215} a drove of buffalo passing in the vicinity,
I requested a chief to take my horse and kill one 'upon
the shares.' He delighted in the sport: so, gathering his
arrows, he mounted the pony, which was slow, and withal
very lean, and giving chase, in a few minutes he had two
buffaloes lying upon the plain, and two others went off so
badly wounded, that, with a little exertion, they might
have been secured.</p>

<p>But the dexterity of the Comanches in the buffalo chase
is perhaps superior to that of any other tribe. The Mexican
<i>Ciboleros</i>, however, are scarcely if at all inferior to the
Indians in this sport. I once went on a hunting expedition
with a Cibolero, who carried no arms except his bow and
arrows and a butcher's knife. Espying a herd of buffalo,
he put spurs to his horse, and, though I followed as fast as
a mule I rode could trudge, when I came up with him,
after a chase of two or three miles, he had the buffalo partly
skinned! This was rather unusual dispatch, to be sure,
for the animal oftener lingers awhile after receiving the
fatal dart.</p>

<p>In the chase, the experienced hunter singles out the
fattest buffalo as his victim, and having given him a mortal
wound, he in like manner selects another, and so on, till
the plain is sometimes literally strewed with carcasses. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg267"></a>[p267]</span></p>

<p>It seems that Capt. Bonneville<a name="FNanchor_167_168" id="FNanchor_167_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_168" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> marvelled greatly that
some Indians, during his peregrinations in the Rocky
Mountains, should have {216} killed buffalo "without
guns or arrows, and with only an old spear;" and he was
no doubt mistaken in supposing "that they had chased the
herds of buffalo at full speed, until they tired them down,
when they easily dispatched them with the spear:" for
both Indians and Mexicans often chase with a long-handled
spear or lance, which, if the horse be well trained, is still
a more expeditious mode of killing them than with the
bow and arrow. An expert lancer will enter a drove, and
drawing up alongside, will pierce buffalo after buffalo
until several are brought down.</p>

<p>In default of bow or lance, they chase with the fusil, but
seldom so successfully as with the former weapons. The
Americans generally prefer 'running' with the horseman's
pistol; yet the Indian is apt to kill double as many with
his arrows or lance.</p>

<p>In all these modes of hunting, the buffalo is sometimes
dangerous; for, becoming enraged from his wounds, he
will often make desperate lunges at his pursuer; and,
if the horse be not well trained, he may be himself disembowelled,
leaving his rider at the mercy of the buffalo, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg268"></a>[p268]</span>
as has happened on some occasions. But if the steed
understand his business, he will dodge the animal with
the expertness of a fencer.</p>

<p>Buffalo calves (but not full-grown buffalo) are often
taken with the lazo by Mexicans and Indians; yet, being
separated from their dams and the droves during chases,
these simple little creatures not unfrequently take up with
{217} the riding animals of the hunters, and follow them
to the camp as tamely as though they were their dams.
If provided with domestic cows, they may be raised without
much difficulty.</p>

<p>Some of the northern Indians, particularly the Assiniboins,<a name="FNanchor_168_169" id="FNanchor_168_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_169" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
are said to practise still a distinct mode of taking
the buffalo. A staunch pound is erected at some convenient
point, and, after a course of mystic rites by their
medicine-men, they start upon the enterprise. A gang
of buffalo is frightened towards the pen, while an Indian,
covered with one of their woolly skins, runs at a distance
ahead. Being seen by the animals, they mistake him
for one of their kind, and follow him into the pen. Once
secured in the enclosure, they leisurely dispatch them with
their arrows, as they are said to believe it would offend
the Great Spirit and render future hunts unpropitious to
use fire arms in killing their imprisoned game.</p>

<p>However, of all other modes, our backwoodsmen prefer
'still-hunting'—that is, stealing upon their game afoot
with the rifle. Buffalo are much more easily approached
than deer. When the hunter perceives a herd at rest, or
quietly feeding, he crawls upon them behind a bank, a
shrub, or a tuft of grass, with the greatest facility, provided
he 'has the wind of them,' as hunters say—that is, if the
wind blows from the buffalo; but if the reverse, he will <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg269"></a>[p269]</span>
find it impossible to approach them, however securely
he may have {218} concealed himself from their sight. In
fact, their scent being acute, they seem to depend more
upon it than their sight; for if a gang of buffalo be frightened,
from any quarter whatever, they are apt to shape their
course against the wind, that they may scent an enemy
in their way.</p>

<p>If the hunter succeed in 'bringing down' his first shot,
he may frequently kill several out of the same herd; for,
should the game neither see nor smell him, they may hear
the rifle-cracks, and witness their companions fall one
after another, without heeding, except to raise their heads,
and perhaps start a little at each report. They would seem
to fancy that the fallen are only lying down to rest, and
they are loth to leave them. On one occasion, upon the
Cimarron river, I saw some ten or a dozen buffaloes lying
upon a few acres of ground, all of which had been shot
from the same herd by a couple of our hunters. Had
not the gang been frightened by the approaching caravan,
perhaps a dozen more of them might have fallen.</p>

<p>A dexterous hunter will sometimes 'crawl upon' a gang
of buffalo, on a perfectly level plain. As their sight is
at best not acute, and is always more or less obscured by
the shaggy hair of their foreheads, they will hardly observe
an approaching enemy when they are feeding, unless the
wind bears them the scent. The hunter is, therefore, careful
to 'have the wind' of them, and crawls slowly and closely
upon the ground, until within gun-shot. If {219} he bring
down the first, the others will perhaps retire a little, when
he may sometimes approach behind the fallen buffalo,
and shoot several others.</p>

<p>The tenacity of these animals for life is often very extraordinary.
When one receives even a mortal shot, he
frequently appears not hurt—he seems to disdain to <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg270"></a>[p270]</span>
flinch—but will curl his tail and step about as though
he neither felt nor feared anything! If left undisturbed,
however, he begins to stagger, and in a few moments expires:
but if provoked, he might run for miles before he
would fall. I have seen a party of hunters around a wounded
and enraged bull, fire, at a few paces distance, a dozen
or two shots, aimed at his very heart, without their seeming
to have any effect till his anger cooled, when in an instant
he would lie lifeless upon the ground. In such cases,
the inexperienced hunter often aims to shoot them in the
brain, but without success. Owing not only to the thickness
of the scull, but to the matted wool upon it, I have
never witnessed an instance of a rifle-ball's penetrating
to the brain of a buffalo bull.</p>

<p>The 'still-hunter' must needs be upon his guard; for the
wounded buffalo is prone to make battle, upon the too near
approach of his enemy. With a little presence of mind,
however, his attacks are easily shunned. If he makes a
lunge, the pedestrian hunter has only to wheel abruptly
to one side; for the animal is apt to pass on in a direct line.
I have never heard of a serious accident of the {220} kind;
yet some frightful though amusing incidents have occurred
in such cases.</p>

<p>The buffalo never attacks, however, except when wounded.
Even the largest droves (the opinion of some travellers
to the contrary notwithstanding), though in the wildest
career, are easily turned from their course by a single man
who may intercept their way. I have crouched in the tall
grass in the direct route of a frighted gang, when, firing
at them on their near approach, they would spread in consternation
to either side. Still their advance is somewhat
frightful—their thundering rumble over the dry plain—their
lion-like fronts and dangling beards—their open
mouths and hanging tongues—as they come on, puffing <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg271"></a>[p271]</span>
like a locomotive engine at every bound, does at first make
the blood settle a little heavy about the heart.</p>

<p>The gait of these animals is a clumsy gallop, and any
common pony can overtake them in the chase; though,
as the hunter would express it, they 'lumber' over the ground
rather deceivingly. The cows are usually much faster
than the bulls. It has been the remark of travellers that
the buffalo jumps up from the ground differently from
any other animal. The horse rises upon his fore feet
first, and the cow upon her hind feet, but the buffalo seems
to spring up on them all at once.</p>

<p>American hunters, as well as Indians, to butcher the
buffalo, generally turn it upon the belly, and commence
on the back. The {221} hump-ribs, tender-loins, and
a few other choice bits being appropriated, the remainder
is commonly left for the wolves. The skin is chiefly used for
buffalo rugs, but for which it is only preserved by the
Indians during fall and winter (and then rarely but
from the cows and bullocks), when the hair is long and
woolly. I have never seen the buffalo hide tanned, but
it seems too porous and spongy to make substantial
leather. Were it valuable, thousands of hides might be
saved that are annually left to the wolves upon the Prairies.</p>

<p>Although the buffalo is the largest, he has by no means
the control among the prairie animals: the sceptre of authority
has been lodged with the large <i>gray wolf</i>. Though but
little larger than the wolf of the United States, he is much
more ferocious. The same species abound throughout
the north of Mexico, where they often kill horses, mules
and cattle of all sizes; and on the Prairies they make considerable
havoc among the buffalo.</p>

<p>Many curious tales are told of the wiles and expedients
practised by these animals to secure their prey. Some <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg272"></a>[p272]</span>
assert that they collect in companies, and chase a buffalo
by turns, till he is fatigued, when they join and soon dispatch
him: others, that, as the buffalo runs with the tongue
hanging out, they snap at it in the chase till it is torn off,
which preventing him from eating, he is reduced by starvation,
and soon overpowered: others, that, while running,
they gnaw and lacerate {222} the legs and ham-strings till
they disable him, and then he is killed by the gang. Be
this as it may, certain it is that they overcome many of the
largest buffaloes, employing perhaps different means of
subduing them, and among these is doubtless the last
mentioned, for I have myself seen them with the muscles
of the thighs cruelly mangled—a consequence no doubt
of some of these attacks. Calves are constantly falling
victims to the rapacity of these wolves; yet, when herds
of buffalo are together, they defend their offspring with
great bravery.</p>

<p>Though the color of this wolf is generally a dirty gray,
it is sometimes met with nearly white. I am of opinion,
however, that the diversity of color originates chiefly from
the different ages of the hair, and the age and condition
of the animal itself. The few white wolves I have seen,
have been lean, long-haired, and apparently very old.
There are immense numbers of them upon the Prairies.
Droves are frequently to be seen following in the wake of
caravans, hunting companies, and itinerant Indian bands,
for weeks together—not, like the jackal, so much to disinter
the dead (though this they sometimes do), as to feast
upon the abandoned carcasses of the buffalo which are
so often wantonly killed and wasted. Unless in these cases,
they are rarely seen, except in the neighborhood of buffalo;
therefore, when the hungry traveller meets with wolves, he
feels some assurance that supplies of his favorite game
are at hand. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg273"></a>[p273]</span></p>

<p>{223} I have never known these animals, rapacious as
they are, [to] extend their attacks to man, though they probably
would, if very hungry and a favorable opportunity
presented itself. I shall not soon forget an adventure with
one of them, many years ago, on the frontier of Missouri.
Riding near the prairie border, I perceived one of the
largest and fiercest of the gray species, which had just
descended from the west, and seemed famished to desperation.
I at once prepared for a chase; and, being without
arms, I caught up a cudgel, when I betook me valiantly
to the charge, much stronger, as I soon discovered, in
my cause than in my equipment. The wolf was in no
humor to flee, however, but boldly met me full half-way.
I was soon disarmed, for my club broke upon the animal's
head. He then 'laid to' my horse's legs, which, not relishing
the conflict, gave a plunge and sent me whirling
over his head, and made his escape, leaving me and the
wolf at close quarters. I was no sooner upon my feet than
my antagonist renewed the charge; but, being without
weapon, or any means of awakening an emotion of terror,
save through his imagination, I took off my large black
hat, and using it for a shield, began to thrust it towards
his gaping jaws. My <i>ruse</i> had the desired effect; for, after
springing at me a few times, he wheeled about and trotted
off several paces, and stopped to gaze at me. Being apprehensive
that he might change his mind and return to the
attack, and conscious that, under the {224} compromise,
I had the best of the bargain, I very resolutely—— took
to my heels, glad of the opportunity of making a drawn
game, though I had myself given the challenge.</p>

<p>There is a small species called the <dfn>prairie wolf</dfn> on the
frontier, and <dfn>coyote</dfn><a name="FNanchor_169_170" id="FNanchor_169_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_170" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> by the Mexicans, which is also found <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg274"></a>[p274]</span>
in immense numbers on the Plains. It is rather smaller
than an ordinary dog, nearly the color of the common gray
wolf, and though as rapacious as the larger kind, it seems
too cowardly to attack stout game. It therefore lives upon
the remains of buffalo killed by hunters and by the large
wolves, added to such small game as hares, prairie dogs,
etc., and even reptiles and insects. It will lie for hours
beside a 'dog-hole,' watching for the appearance of the
little animal, which no sooner peeps out than the enemy
pounces upon it.</p>

<p>The coyote has been denominated the 'jackal of the
Prairies;' indeed, some have reckoned it really a species
of that animal, yet it would seem improperly, as this creature
{225} partakes much less of the nature of the jackal than
of the common wolf. Still, however noisy the former may
be, he cannot exceed the prairie wolf. Like ventriloquists,
a pair of these will represent a dozen distinct voices in such
quick succession—will bark, chatter, yelp, whine, and
howl in such variety of note, that one would fancy a score
of them at hand. This, added to the long and doleful
bugle-note of the large wolf, which often accompanies it,
sometimes makes a night upon the Prairies perfectly hideous.—Some
hunters assert that the coyote and the dog will
breed together. Be this as it may, certain it is that the
Indian dogs have a wonderfully wolfish appearance.</p>

<p>The <i>elk</i> as well as the <i>deer</i> is found somewhat abundant <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg275"></a>[p275]</span>
upon the Arkansas river, as high as the Santa Fé road,
but from thence westward they are both very scarce; for
these animals do not resort to the high prairie plains. Further
south, however, in the prairies bordering the brushy
tributaries of the Canadian and Red River, deer are exceedingly
plenty—herds of hundreds are sometimes seen
together; but in these southern regions there are but few
elks.</p>

<p>About the thickety streams above-mentioned, as well
as among the Cross Timbers, the <i>black bear</i> is very common,
living chiefly upon acorns and other fruits. The grape
vines and the branches of the scrubby oaks, and plum-bushes,
are in some places so torn and broken by the
bear in pursuit of fruits, that a stranger {226} would conclude
a violent hurricane had passed among them.</p>

<p>That species of gazelle known as the <i>antelope</i> is very
numerous upon the high plains. This beautiful animal,
though reckoned a link between the deer and goat, is certainly
much nearest the latter. It is about the size and
somewhat of the figure of a large goat. Its horns also
resemble those of the latter, being likewise persistent;
but they are more erect, and have a short prong projecting
in front. The ground of this animal's color a little resembles
that of the common deer, but it is variegated with a
whitish section or two on each side.</p>

<p>The antelope is most remarkable for its fleetness: not
bounding like the deer, but skimming over the ground
as though upon skates. The fastest horse will rarely
overtake them. I once witnessed an effort to catch one
that had a hind-leg broken, but it far outstripped our
fleetest 'buffalo-horse.' It is, therefore, too swift to be
hunted in the chase. I have seen dogs run after this animal,
but they would soon stop and turn about, apparently much
ashamed of being left so far behind. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg276"></a>[p276]</span></p>

<p>The flesh of the antelope is, like that of the goat, rather
coarse, and but little esteemed: consequently, no great
efforts are made to take them. Being as wild as fleet,
the hunting of them is very difficult, except they be entrapped
by their curiosity. Meeting a stranger, they seem
loth to leave him until they have fully found him out. They
will often {227} take a circuit around the object of their
curiosity, usually approaching nearer and nearer, until
within rifle-shot—frequently stopping to gaze. Also, they
are often decoyed with a scarlet coat, or a red handkerchief
attached to the tip of a ramrod, which will sometimes
allure them within reach of the hunter's aim. But this
interesting animal, like the buffalo, is now very rarely seen
within less than 200 miles of the frontier: though early
voyagers tell us that it once frequented as far east as the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>The <i>bighorn</i> (<dfn>carnero cimarron</dfn>, as called by the Mexicans,
and sometimes known to trappers as the mountain sheep),
so abundant in most of the Rocky Mountain chain, is found
in the spurs and table-plain cliffs about the sources of the
Cimarron river (whence this stream acquired its name),
as well as in the highland gorges, and other parts of those
mountain borders. Its flesh is said to be excellent, and
is preferred by many hunters to venison. It is larger than
a common sheep, and covered with brownish hair instead
of wool—darker than the deer, but whitish on the belly.
It is most remarkable for its huge spiral horns, resembling
in shape and curvature those of the sheep, but sometimes
over three feet long, and four to six inches in diameter at
the base.<a name="FNanchor_170_171" id="FNanchor_170_171"></a>

<p>{228} The bighorn is quite celebrated for its agility, and
its habit of secluding itself among the most inaccessible
mountain crags. It seems to delight in perching and
capering upon the very verge of the most frightful precipices
and overhanging cliffs, and in skipping from rock
to rock, regardless of the yawning chasms, hundreds of
feet in depth, which intervene. In fact, when pursued,
it does not hesitate, as I have been assured, to leap from
a cliff into a valley a hundred or more feet below, where,
lighting upon its huge horns, it springs to its feet uninjured;
for the neck is so thick and strong as to support the greatest
shock the animal's weight can bring upon it. Being exceedingly
timorous, it rarely descends to the valleys, but
feeds and sleeps about such craggy fastnesses as are inaccessible
to the wolves and other animals of prey. This
animal seems greatly to resemble the <i>moufflon</i> of Buffon,
in color, figure and horns, but the <i>chamois</i> in habits.</p>

<p>But of all the prairie animals, by far the most curious,
and by no means the least celebrated, is the little <i>prairie
dog</i>. This singular quadruped is but little larger than a
common squirrel, its body being nearly a foot long, with a
tail of three or four inches. The color ranges from brown
to a dirty yellow. The flesh, though often eaten by travellers,
is not esteemed savory. It was denominated the
'barking squirrel,' the 'prairie ground-squirrel,' etc., by
early explorers, with much more apparent propriety than
the present established {229} name. Its yelp, which resembles
that of the little toy-dog, seems its only canine
attribute. It rather appears to occupy a middle ground
betwixt the rabbit and squirrel—like the former in feeding
and burrowing—like the latter in frisking, flirting, sitting
erect, and somewhat so in its barking.</p>

<p>The prairie dog has been reckoned by some naturalists
a species of the marmot (<i>arctomys ludoviciana</i>); yet it seems <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg278"></a>[p278]</span>
to possess scarce any other quality in common with this
animal except that of burrowing. Some have supposed,
it is true, that like the marmot, they lie torpid during the
cold season; and it is observed in 'Long's Expedition,'
that, "as they pass the winter in a lethargic state, they
lay up no provisions," &#38;c.: but this is no doubt erroneous;
for I have the concurrent testimony of several persons,
who have been upon the Prairies in winter, that, like rabbits
and squirrels, they issue from their holes every soft day;
and therefore lay up no doubt a hoard of 'hay' (as there
is rarely anything else to be found in the vicinity of their
towns) for winter's use.</p>

<p>A collection of their burrows has been termed by travellers
a 'dog town,' which comprises from a dozen or so, to
some thousands in the same vicinity; often covering an
area of several square miles. They generally locate upon
firm dry plains, coated with fine short grass, upon which
they feed; for they are no doubt exclusively herbivorous.
But even when tall coarse grass surrounds, they seem commonly
to destroy this within their 'streets,' {230} which
are nearly always found 'paved' with a fine species suited
to their palates. They must need but little water, if any
at all, as their 'towns' are often, indeed generally, found
in the midst of the most arid plains—unless we suppose
they dig down to subterranean fountains. At least they
evidently burrow remarkably deep. Attempts either to
dig or drown them out of their holes have generally proved
unsuccessful.</p>

</div>

<p>Approaching a 'village,' the little dogs may be observed
frisking about the 'streets'—passing from dwelling to
dwelling apparently on visits—sometimes a few clustered
together as though in council—here feeding upon the
tender herbage—there cleansing their 'houses,' or brushing
the little hillock about the door—yet all quiet. Upon
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg281"></a>[p281]</span> seeing a stranger, however, each streaks it to its home,
but is apt to stop at the entrance, and spread the general
alarm by a succession of shrill yelps, usually sitting erect.
Yet at the report of a gun or the too near approach of the
visitor, they dart down and are seen no more till the cause
of alarm seems to have disappeared.</p>

<p>Two other animals appear to live in communion with the
prairie dogs—the <i>rattle-snake</i> and a small <i>owl</i>;<a name="FNanchor_171_172" id="FNanchor_171_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_172" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> but both
are no doubt intruders, resorting to these burrows for
shelter, and to feed, it is presumed, upon the 'pups' of the
inmates.</p>

<p>{231} Rattle-snakes are exceedingly abundant upon these
plains: scores of them are sometimes killed in the course
of a day's travel; yet they seem remarkably harmless, for
I have never witnessed an instance of a man's being bitten,
though they have been known to crawl even into the beds
of travellers.<a name="FNanchor_172_173" id="FNanchor_172_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_173" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Mules are sometimes bitten by them,
yet very rarely, though they must daily walk over considerable
numbers.</p>

<p>The <dfn>horned frog</dfn>, as modern travellers have christened
it, or horned lizard,<a name="FNanchor_173_174" id="FNanchor_173_174"></a><a
href="#Footnote_173_174" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> as those of earlier times more rationally
called it, is the most famed and curious reptile of the
plains. Like the prairie dog, it is only found in the dry
regions, often many miles from water. It no doubt lives
nearly, if not wholly, without drink. Its food probably
consists chiefly of ants and other insects; though many
Mexicans will have it, that the <dfn>camaleon</dfn> (as they call it)
<dfn>vive del aire</dfn>—lives upon the air. It has been kept several <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg282"></a>[p282]</span>
months without partaking of a particle of aliment. I once
took a pair of them upon the far-western plains, which I
shut up in a box and carried to one of the eastern cities,
where they were kept for several months before they died,—without
having taken food or water, though repeatedly
offered them.</p>

<p>{232} The whole length of the horned frog is from two
to five inches—body flatted horizontally, oval-shaped,
and between one and two inches wide in the middle. The
back is beautifully variegated, with white and brown, and
sometimes a yellowish purple. The belly is whitish and
covered with brown specks. It acquired its name from
a pair of short horns projecting from the top of the head—with
other smaller horny protuberances upon the head and
body. It has a short tail, which gives it a lizard-like appearance.
It is a very inoffensive creature, and may be
handled with perfect impunity, notwithstanding its uncouth
appearance, and sometimes vicious demonstrations.</p>

<p>As birds mostly incline to the timbered regions, there
is but a scant variety to be met with upon the plains. About
the Cross Timbers and indeed on all the brushy creeks,
especially to the southward, are quantities of wild <i>turkeys</i>,
which are frequently seen ranging in large flocks in the
bordering prairies. That species of American grouse,
known west as the <i>prairie-hen</i>, is very abundant on the
frontier, and is quite destructive, in autumn, to the prairie
corn-fields. This fowl is rarely seen over two hundred
miles beyond the border. <i>Partridges</i> are found about as
far west; but their number is quite limited anywhere beyond
the precincts of the settlements. About the streams
there are different species of geese and ducks, as well as
both sand-hill and white cranes: also flocks of a species
of plover and {233} curlew. Add to these numbers of
hawks and ravens, and we have most of the fowls of the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg283"></a>[p283]</span>
Prairies. Flocks of the latter follow in the wake of caravans
with even greater constancy than wolves.</p>

<p>The <i>bee</i>, among Western pioneers, is the proverbial precursor
of the Anglo-American population: in fact, the
aborigines of the frontier have generally corroborated
the notion; for they used to say, they knew the whites were
not far behind, when bees appeared among them. This
partial coincidence, I suppose, is the result of their emigration
westward being at nearly an even pace with that
of the settlers. As yet no honey-bees seem to have been
discovered as far westward as any part of the Rocky Mountains.
They are scattered, however, to the distance of
two or three hundred miles west of the Missouri and Arkansas
frontier, where there is timber affording them suitable
habitations. On the Santa Fé route but few have been
found beyond the Council Grove.</p>

early age he came to America with his mother, where he was cared for by Thomas
Paine, who secured for him a cadetship in the United States Military Academy, from
which he was graduated in 1819, when he entered the army. During Lafayette's
visit of 1825, Bonneville was detailed as his aide. He was later stationed on the
Western frontier, and obtaining leave of absence (1831) planned an extensive
fur-trading and exploring expedition. This is the journey graphically described
by Washington Irving, in <cite>Rocky Mountains, or Scenes, Incidents and Adventures
in the far West, digested from the journal of B. L. E. Bonneville of the army of the
United States</cite> (Phila., 1837). Bonneville was absent from civilization for three
years (1832-35), and wandered as far west as the Columbia. His trading venture
was but moderately successful, and he returned to army life, participating in both
the Seminole and Mexican wars, in the latter of which he was severely wounded.
During the War of Secession, he was stationed chiefly at frontier posts, being
breveted brigadier-general in 1865. He died at Fort Smith in 1878.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

A similar propensity is observable among us to refer nearly all American animals
to European species, whereas but very few that are legitimately indigenous to this
continent, agree in every particular to those of the Old World. It would surely
have contributed to the copiousness and euphony of the language, as well as to
perspicuity in the distinction of species, had we, like the Mexicans, retained the

<p>It will hardly be expected from a work making so little
pretension as this to scientific accuracy and completeness,
that the remarks which my plan necessarily leads me to
make, concerning the aborigines of western America,
should be either critical or comprehensive. Neither can
I feel that it is a topic which I am at liberty wholly to disregard.
The opportunities which I have enjoyed for <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg284"></a>[p284]</span>
obtaining a knowledge of the character and habits of the
western Indians have been such, that I trust that a brief
account of them may prove in some measure new, and not
altogether uninteresting to a portion of my readers. Impressed
with this belief, I propose, in the few {235} following
pages, to record such facts as shall seem to be most novel,
and to corroborate, in my humble measure, occasional
others which have before been related. With this view,
I shall proceed to notice, in the present chapter, such leading
characteristics of the aborigines generally, as shall
seem most noteworthy; and then, in those that follow, ask
the reader's attention to many peculiarities which make the
most conspicuous differences between them.</p>

<p>No aboriginal nation or people has ever yet been discovered,
to my knowledge, which has not professed to
have a mysterious ancestry of a mythical character. It
is interesting to mark the analogies and the differences
between their various systems. Although among some
tribes who have lived much in communication with the
whites, their cosmogony has been confounded very much
with the Mosaic or Scripture account, so that it is now
often difficult to distinguish clearly the aboriginal from
the imported, yet all the Americo-Indian tribes have more
or less preserved their traditions on this subject. The
old full-blood Choctaws, for instance, relate that the first
of their tribe issued from a cave in Nunnewaya or Bending
Mountain, in the 'Old Nation,' east of the Mississippi;
yet this tradition has but little currency among the young
men and mixed-bloods of the tribe. The minute account
of this supposed origin cannot now be readily procured;
yet some idea may be formed of it from a kindred tradition
among {236} the Mandans which has been preserved to
us by Lewis and Clark, and is thus related: <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg285"></a>[p285]</span></p>

<p>"The whole nation resided in one large village under
ground near a subterraneous lake: a grape vine extended
its roots down to their habitation and gave them a view of
the light: some of the most adventurous climbed up the
vine, and were delighted with the sight of the earth, which
they found covered with buffalo, and rich with every kind
of fruits: returning with the grapes they had gathered, their
countrymen were so pleased with the taste of them that
their whole nation resolved to leave their dull residence for
the charms of the upper regions; men, women and children
ascended by means of the vine; but when about half the
nation had reached the surface of the earth, a corpulent
woman who was clambering up the vine broke it with her
weight, and closed upon herself and the rest of the nation,
the light of the sun."<a name="FNanchor_174_175" id="FNanchor_174_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_175" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Besides the Mandans it seems that other neighboring
tribes had somewhat analogous notions of their origin.
An early explorer relates that the Osages believed that
their fore-fathers grew from a snail, which, having become
a man, married the daughter of a beaver, whence sprang
the present race.</p>

<p>The resemblance of the American Indians to each other,
however, is not more conspicuous in anything than in their
religious opinions. They seem to have no well-defined
creeds: yet there are very few but profess a faith in some
sort of First Cause—a Great {237} Spirit, a Master of
Life, who rules the destinies of the world. Though the
different nations have not always typified their deity by
the same objects, yet by far the greater number seem to
have fixed upon the sun as the fit object of their adoration.<a name="FNanchor_175_176" id="FNanchor_175_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_176" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
"Next to <dfn>Virachocha</dfn>, or their supreme God," says Father <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg286"></a>[p286]</span>
Acosta,<a name="FNanchor_176_177" id="FNanchor_176_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_177" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> speaking of the Indians of Peru, "that which
most commonly they have and do adore amongst the Infidells
is the Sunne." Many of the Mexican tribes<a name="FNanchor_177_178" id="FNanchor_177_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_178" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> profess
the same faith, and particularly those of New Mexico,
as has already been mentioned. This seems also the
most current among the Comanches and other wild tribes
of the Prairies: and the Choctaws and several other nations
of the frontier appear at least to have held the sun in great
veneration.</p>

<p>But of all the Indian tribes, none appear to have ascribed
to the 'fountain of light' more of the proper attributes of
deity than the Shawnees. They argue, with some plausibility,
that the sun animates everything—therefore, he is
clearly the Master of Life, or the Great Spirit; and that
everything is produced originally from the bosom of the
earth—therefore, she is the mother of creation. The
following anecdote<a name="FNanchor_178_179" id="FNanchor_178_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_179" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> (as told to me by a gentleman of
integrity), which transpired upon {238} the occasion of an
interview of Tecumseh with Gen. Harrison, is as illustrative
of the religious opinions of the Shawnees, as it is characteristic
of the hauteur and independent spirit of that celebrated <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg287"></a>[p287]</span>
Shawnee chief. The General, having called Tecumseh
for a 'talk,' desired him to take a seat, saying, "Come
here, Tecumseh, and sit by your father." "You my
father?" replied the chief, with a stern air—"No! yonder
sun is my father (pointing towards it), and the earth is
my mother; so I will rest on her bosom"—and immediately
seated himself upon the ground, according to Indian
custom.</p>

<p>But though the Shawnees consider the sun the type,
if not the essence, of the Great Spirit, many also believe in
an evil genius, who makes all sorts of bad things, to counterbalance
those made by the Good Spirit. For instance,
when the latter made a sheep, a rose, wholesome herbs, etc.,
the bad spirit matched them with a wolf, a thorn, poisonous
plants, and the like. They also appear to think there
is a kind of purgatory in which the spirits of the wicked
may be cleansed before entering into their elysium.</p>

<p>The worship of all the aborigines seems to consist chiefly
in feasting and dancing. A worthy missionary among the
Shawnees related to me the following legendary tradition,
as explanatory of their ideas of another world, and the
institution of their worship, which may serve as a fair
sample of the traditions of many other tribes.</p>

<p>{239} In days of yore (say the Shawnees) there lived a
pious brother and an affectionate sister, who were inordinately
attached to each other. It came to pass that the
sister sickened and died, and was carried to the world of
spirits. The good brother was inconsolable, and for a
while refused to eat or drink, or to partake of any kind of
nourishment: he wished to follow his beloved sister. At
length he resolved to set out in search of her; so he commenced
his pilgrimage toward the setting sun. Steadily
pursuing the same course for days and moons together,
he at last came to where the sky and earth meet; and finding <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg288"></a>[p288]</span>
an opening, he ascended into the upper regions. He
now turned his course towards the rising sun, which he
continued, above the sky, till he came to the abode of his
grandfather—which seems but another name for one of
the good spirits. This sage, knowing his errand, gave
him 'medicine' to transform him into a spirit, that he
might pass through the celestial courts. He also gave him
instructions how to proceed, and where he would find his
sister. He said she would be at a dance; and when she
rose to join in the amusement, he must seize and ensconce
her in the hollow of a reed with which he was furnished,
and cover the orifice with the end of his finger.</p>

<p>After an arduous peregrination through the land of
spirits, the brother found and secured his sister as directed.
He returned with his charge to the habitation of his grandfather,
who gave another 'medicine' to transform {240}
them both into material beings again, that they might
revisit their brothers on earth. The sage also explained
to them the mysteries of heaven and the sacred rites of
worship, that they might instruct their tribe therein. When
about to start back, the venerable spirit told them that the
route by which the brother had come was very circuitous—there
was a much nearer way; and opening a trap-door
through the sky, they beheld their native town just below
them. So the good brother and sister descended; and
returning home, a great feast was celebrated, accompanied
by a solemn dance—in accordance with the grandfather's
instructions. Thus originated, as they say, the sacred
dances and other religious ceremonies now in practice.</p>

<p>As they believe the Indian heaven separate, and essentially
different and distinct from that of the whites, and as
they do not wish their people divided, this has often occasioned
a serious opposition to the labors of the missionaries.<a name="FNanchor_179_180" id="FNanchor_179_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_180" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg289"></a>[p289]</span>
For the purpose of thwarting the {241} measures of these,
a noted anti-christian sage 'played off,' a few years ago,
the following 'vision.' Being very ill (as they relate), this
sage, to all appearance, died, and became stiff and cold,
except a spot upon his breast, which still retained the heat
of life. In this state he remained a day or more, when he
again breathed and returned among the living: and calling
his friends about him, he related the scenes he had witnessed.
He had ascended to the Indian's heaven, he said, which he
described as usual: a fine country, abounding in all sorts
of game, and everything an Indian could desire. There
he met with his grandfather, who said to him, "It is meet,
my son, that thou return to the earth, and warn thy brothers
against the dangers that await them. Tell them to beware
of the religion of the white man: that every Indian who
embraces it is obliged to take the road to the white man's
heaven; and yet no red man is permitted to enter there,
but will have to wander about forever without a resting-place."</p>

<p>The identity of the notions which the different tribes
have conceived of a future existence, and the character of
the 'world of spirits,' seems still more general. They <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg290"></a>[p290]</span>
fancy {242} heaven but another material world, superior,
it is true, yet resembling this—a kind of elysian vale, or
paradise—a 'happy hunting-ground,' abounding in game
and all their comforts of life, which may be procured without
labor. This elysium they generally seem to locate
'upon the sky,' which they fancy a material solid vault.
It appears impossible for them, in their pristine barbarism,
to conceive of a spiritual existence, or of a world differing
materially from that which they see around them.</p>

<p>Father Hennepin (writing about 1680) relates, that the
northern Indians inquired about the manner of living in
heaven, and remarks: "When I made answer that they
live there without eating or drinking, 'We will not go
thither,' said they, 'because we must not eat;' and when
I have added that there would be no occasion for food there,
they clapt their hands to their mouths, as a sign of admiration,
and said, '<em>Thou art a great liar!—is there anything
can live without eating?</em>'"<a name="FNanchor_180_181" id="FNanchor_180_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_181" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Similar opinions, among many different tribes, I have
heard declared in direct terms; yet, did we want further
testimony, some of their burial customs and funeral rites
would seem to indicate their ideas of the future state. The
Cherokees, Choctaws, Creeks, Kansas, and kindred tribes,
besides many others, or perhaps most others of the frontier,
have been accustomed to inter the most valuable property
of the deceased and many necessaries with them. "Their
whole property was buried {243} with them,"<a name="FNanchor_181_182" id="FNanchor_181_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_182" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> says an
intelligent Cherokee, in some manuscript notes concerning
his ancestors, I have in my possession: and I have been
assured by creditable natives, that, within their recollection <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg291"></a>[p291]</span>
they have seen, at these burials, provisions, salt, and other
necessaries, interred with the dead for their long journey.</p>

<p>There are very few of the prairie Indians but practise
something of this kind: many kill the favorite hunting-horses,
and deposit the arms, etc., of the deceased, for
his use in the chase, when he arrives at the 'happy hunting
ground.' We are also informed by Capt. Bonneville, and
other travellers, that this is practised by some, if not all,
of the natives beyond the Rocky Mountains. The same
is told of the Navajoes, Apaches, and other uncatholicized
tribes of the north of Mexico.</p>

<p>Peter Martyr, a learned and celebrated protestant divine,
who wrote his "Decades of the Newe Worlde"<a name="FNanchor_182_183" id="FNanchor_182_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_183" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> towards
the middle of the sixteenth century, observes that, "in
many places of the firme lande, when any of the kynges
dye, all his householde servauntes, as well women as men
which have continually served hym, kyl themselves, beleavynge,
as they are taught by the devyl <i>Tuyra</i>, that they
which kyll themselves when the kynge dyeth, go with hym
to heaven and serve hym in the same place and office as
they dyd before on {244} the earth whyle he lyved.<a name="FNanchor_183_184" id="FNanchor_183_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_184" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> And
that all that refuse so to doo, when after they dye by theyr
naturall death or otherwyse, theyr soules to dye with theyr
bodyes, and to bee dissolved into ayer and become nothynge
as do the soules of hogges, byrdes or fysshes, or other brute <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg292"></a>[p292]</span>
beastes."<a name="FNanchor_184_185" id="FNanchor_184_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_185" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> In corroboration of a similar custom among
the natives along the Mississippi, in 1542, Herrera relates,<a name="FNanchor_185_186" id="FNanchor_185_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_186" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
that, after the death of Fernando de Soto, and his party
had set out westward, they were joined by a youth, who
stated that he had fled to escape being buried with his lord
who had died; which was the practice in that country.
Travellers from the upper lakes to the Mississippi speak
of similar customs, at an early day, among the tribes of that
quarter.</p>

<p>It would appear that they believe everything, both animate
and inanimate—beasts, arms, ornaments, etc.—to
possess immortal attributes, subject to resurrection in
the world of spirits. However, did not their motives seem
so well defined by the direct allusions to their notions of
futurity, we might suppose, as is frequently urged, that the
burying of property, slaves, etc., with the deceased, was
only intended as a mark of respect; which, indeed, is hardly
more irrational than the custom {245} of interring costly
garniture and appendages with the dead among us.</p>

<p>Some of the modes of burial adopted by the American
aborigines are different, I believe, from those of any other
people. Though, as among civilized nations, even the
wildest tribes sometimes inter in ordinary graves, yet they
frequently deposit their dead, in a sitting and even in a
standing posture, in pits, caves, and hollow trees; and
occasionally, they lay the corpse out upon scaffolds suspended
from the branches of trees, or resting upon them
where they will admit of it, so as to be out of reach of the
wolves and other beasts.</p>

<p>I was once, with a little caravan, travelling up the course
of the Arkansas river, when, a thunder-storm coming up <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg293"></a>[p293]</span>
suddenly, and night drawing near, we turned the wagons
as soon as we could, to the river-bank, to encamp. The
bustle of ungearing and securing the teams before they
should be frightened by the tempest, was hardly over,
when we discovered a platform suspended above our heads,
upon the branches of a cottonwood, which, upon examination,
was found to contain an Indian corpse, from whose
bones the putrid flesh had not yet separated!</p>

<p>This mode of disposing of the dead would seem once
to have been quite extensive; for, as well as upon the western
prairies, it formerly prevailed among the Potawatomies
of the north, and the Choctaws of the south, at least while
on their expeditions. In this case, if practicable, they
would leave a band of {246} aged men, known as bone-pickers,'
to clean the bones, when the flesh decayed, and
carry them to their village for interment.</p>

<p>Barbarians are generally superstitious to an extreme,
believing in hobgoblins, witchcraft, legerdemain and all
sorts of mummeries.<a name="FNanchor_186_187" id="FNanchor_186_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_187" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Like many grandmothers in backwoods
life, they delight in recounting the extraordinary
apparitions, transmigrations, sorceries, etc., which they
pretend to have witnessed. Nothing seems too absurd for
their belief. Among many other cases of similar cast,
an intelligent Potawatomie once assured me that he had
witnessed the death of one of his nation, who had received <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg294"></a>[p294]</span>
a stab in his side with a knife (probably in some illicit
adventure); and it being unknown to his friends how the
wound had been inflicted, it was currently reported and
believed, that from their {247} present home on the frontier
of Missouri, he had visited the 'Old Nation' in Michigan,<a name="FNanchor_187_188" id="FNanchor_187_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_188" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
poisoned an enemy there, received the fatal stab,
and returned and died, all in one day.</p>

<p>If you tell an Indian that such things are absurd and
impossible, he is apt to answer, "It may be so with the white
man, but how do you know it to be impossible with the
Indian? You tell us many strange things which happened
to your fathers—we don't contradict them, though we
believe such things never could have happened to the red
man." Or, they will reply, perhaps, as they did to Father
Hennepin in a similar case: "Fie, thou knowest not what
thou sayest; thou may'st know what has passed in thy own
Country, for thy Ancestors have told thee of them; but thou
canst not know what has passed in ours before the Spirits
(that is to say the Europeans) came hither."</p>

<p>In their matrimonial customs there is also a similarity
among most of the American savages. Polygamy seems
once to have been universal; and I believe still is so among
the uncivilized tribes. Every man takes as many wives
as he can obtain, or is able to support. The squaws, however,
the more willingly consent to this multiplicity, as it
affords additional helpmates in their labors. Polygamy
among these savages would appear, indeed, not altogether
an unwise provision. At least it seems palliated with such <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg295"></a>[p295]</span>
a belligerent people, who lose so many males in their continual
wars, leaving a great surplus of females; and {248}
where the duties of the latter are so numerous and so severe.</p>

<p>The custom of buying wives, or at least making large
presents to their parents, has always been very general;
and still exists, not only among the more savage, but even
with many of the partially civilized nations. Yet, notwithstanding
their depravity in other respects, there is one
thing truly remarkable in their marriages. All modern
observers seem to agree with the ancient authors, that they
universally abhor incestuous connections. Among the
Creeks, even the marrying of cousins was punished by
cutting off the ears. The Cherokees (according to some
manuscript notes which I have of an intelligent member
of the tribe) were prohibited from marrying in their own
clans (i. e. kindred) under penalty of death; and their clans
themselves were their executioners. But, although the
Indians thus so strictly prohibit marriage within the degree
of consanguinity, it is not so with those of affinity among
many tribes. The Otoes, Kansas, and others of the same
stock, will not only marry several sisters, but their deceased
brothers' wives; in fact, this last seems considered a duty
so that the orphan children of the brother may not be without
a protector.<a name="FNanchor_188_189" id="FNanchor_188_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_189" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>While the aborigines of the New World {249} have been
noted above almost every other uncivilized nation in history,
for their vindictiveness and cruelty towards their enemies,
there are, in these attributes, wide differences apparent
among them. The Indians along the Pacific coast, as
well as in most of Mexico, were always more mild and
peaceable than those of the United States. Hence it is, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg296"></a>[p296]</span>
in fact, that the Spaniards did not meet with that formidable
resistance to their conquests which they encountered among
the fiery tribes of Florida, or that relentless and desperate
hostility which the Anglo-Americans experienced in the
first settlement of most parts of the United States.</p>

<p>But in the common trait of hospitality to strangers all
the western tribes are alike distinguished. The traveller
who is thrown upon their charity, is almost universally
received and treated with the greatest kindness; and,
though they might pilfer him to the skin, and even place
his person in jeopardy, if he show want of confidence in
them, and endeavor to conceal his effects, yet his property
is generally secure when under their charge: they appear
to consider a breach of confidence one of the greatest crimes.</p>

<p>Among the wild tribes, as well as among most of the
unadulterated border Indians, to set something to eat before
a friend, and even a stranger, immediately upon his arrival
at a lodge or a cabin, is deemed not only an act of hospitality
but of necessary etiquette; and a refusal to partake is looked
upon as an unfriendly {250} token—an insult, in fact, to
the family. Travellers are often severely taxed to preserve
the good feeling of their hosts in this particular, especially
among the prairie Indians. One at all fastidious in matters
of diet, would find it hard to relish food from a greasy hornspoon
which every urchin had been using; and then to
ladle it out of a pot which had been common for all the
papooses and pups of the premises: or to partake from a
slice rolled up in a musty skin, or a dirtier blanket. And
yet an apology even of having already dined half-a-dozen
times would scarcely palliate the insult of a refusal. Though
one visit fifty lodges in the course of a day, he must taste
the food of every one.</p>

<p>The Indian system of chiefs, which still prevails, and
is nearly the same everywhere, except with the Cherokees, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg297"></a>[p297]</span>
Choctaws, Chickasaws, and the Creeks to a degree, seems
to bear a strong resemblance to that of the patriarchs of
old; which, with their clans so analogous to those of our
forefathers, perhaps affords as strong a proof as any other
of their Asiatic origin.<a name="FNanchor_189_190" id="FNanchor_189_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_190" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> To this might be added their
{251} mode of naming;<a name="FNanchor_190_191" id="FNanchor_190_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_191" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> for the Indians universally apply <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg298"></a>[p298]</span>
names significant of acts, qualities, beasts, birds, etc., to
their offspring,—a practice which seems to have prevailed
generally among the ancient Asiatics. Surnames have
only been adopted by educated families {252} and mixed-bloods
of the border nations, and are generally taken from
their missionaries or some favorite friends; except they
inherit surnames from parents of white extraction.</p>

<p>That the Indians of America are decreasing in numbers is
very well known, but many are dwindling away, perhaps,
at a more rapid pace than is generally suspected. The
number of the Osages, it is confidently believed, has diminished
fifty per cent. within the last ten years: the once
powerful tribe of Missouries is now reduced to a mere
remnant; while the Mandans, as a nation, have become
entirely extinct: and others have shared or bid fair soon
to share the same fate. This has resulted partially from
the ravages of the small-pox and other diseases, yet as much
no doubt from the baneful effects of intoxicating liquors.
On this account, their diminution has generally been less
in proportion as they are more remote from the whites.
But the 'red man' has suffered from his intercourse with the
whites not in this respect alone. The incentives to luxury
and avarice continually presented by them, have had a very
pernicious influence. Formerly the savages were contented
with the indispensables of life—generally sober,
just and charitable; but now they will sacrifice their comfort—risk
their lives, and commit the most atrocious outrages
to gratify their vanity and lusts—to bedeck themselves
with gewgaws and finery.</p>

<p>For the purpose of a somewhat more discriminating
notice of the Indian tribes beyond our western border—for
it is to those I intend my remarks, in these pages, to be
strictly confined—I will distinguish them, according to
the prevailing classification of the West, as 'Frontier' or
'Border Indians,' which title includes those occupying that
district lying west of and immediately adjoining Arkansas
and Missouri, and known as the <dfn>Indian Territory</dfn>; and
the 'Wild Tribes' or 'Prairie Indians,' by which are meant
those who are found west of the others, and who range
those immense {254} plains from the borders of the Indian
Territory to the Rocky Mountains. Of these I will speak
in their order.</p>

<p>The most important of the frontier tribes, as is well
known, are the Cherokees, Choctaws and Chickasaws,
Creeks and Seminoles, Shawnees, Delawares, etc. It is
equally well known that most of these tribes were removed
from within the States, not less because of the vicious propensities
which they contracted and the imposition to which
they were continually exposed, than on account of the
difficulty of maintaining peaceful relations between them
and our own citizens, while they remained in their midst.
Their situation within the States certainly presented quite <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg300"></a>[p300]</span>
an anomaly in government—independent powers within
the limits of others claiming sovereign jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_191_192" id="FNanchor_191_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_192" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>A mistaken philanthropy—mistaken for want of a full
knowledge of all the bearings of the subject—among some
people, has occasioned much censure upon this branch
of the policy of our government. But were we to take into
consideration the treatment of other nations towards the
aborigines of America, that of the United States, when
placed in contrast, would certainly present a very benevolent
aspect. They have always been removed by their
own consent, obtained through their chiefs and councils;
and have not only been given equal amounts of land, west
of the border, but have generally been removed and furnished
a year's subsistence {255} at the expense of the government,
and received valuable equivalents beside, in utensils
and other necessaries, and in regular annuities. These
are sums, generally in money, annually paid, for a series
of years, to the several tribes, proportioned usually to the
size of the tribe and the amount of territory acquired from
it. This institution of annuities, however, though intended
as the most charitable, has doubtless been the most injurious
branch of the policy of the United States towards the Indians.
Being thus afforded the means of living without much labor,
they have neglected manufactures, and even agriculture,
to a considerable degree, and many of them have acquired <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg301"></a>[p301]</span>
confirmed habits of indolence and dissipation; and now
that their annuities are growing short, they are being left
destitute, without the energy, the industry, or the means
wherewith to procure a livelihood.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding the constant efforts of the general
government to make them comfortable, and the immense
sums of money which have been paid them, and their being
located in regions far better suited to their wants and their
habits of life than those they abandoned, many of them
appear greatly dissatisfied with the change and with the
government; which seems painfully demonstrative of that
perverse, restless disposition, which appears ever to have
characterized the conduct of half-civilized nations.</p>

<p>One ostensible reason for their unwillingness {256} to
remove, has been a reluctance to abandon their native
homes and the 'graves of their fathers.' Many fabulous
legends are told of the attachment of the Indian to his
native soil, yet but few who are acquainted with their
habitudes, will place much stress on this. Their own
traditions, as well as experience, have shown, that, when
left to themselves, they incline to migrate; of which the
Azteques of Mexico, and the Osages, with others of our
border, afford striking examples: in fact, there is scarcely
a tribe on the frontier which has not its traditions of migrations
at some period. The Shawnees say their forefathers
emigrated from the south to the regions north of the Ohio—the
Creeks, as well as many of the Choctaws, that they
were originally from west of the Mississippi—besides
many other cases.</p>

<p>But, with regard to this passage of our country's history,
I will merely say, in addition, that, so far as I am able to
judge, the condition of the 'red man' has been very materially
bettered by the change. The lands they at present
occupy are, for the most part, of a more fertile character <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg302"></a>[p302]</span>
than those which they have left. The climate is equally
or perhaps more healthy, in general; notwithstanding the
dreadful mortality which afflicted many of them shortly
after their removal—a calamity which was attributable,
primarily, to the change of climate, as well as to the change
of habits which their new dwelling-places involved; and
secondarily, to the too abundant use of {257} spirituous
liquors, with which they were frequently provided by both
native and white peddlers and traders, before any measures,
efficient enough to check the evil, were taken either by
themselves or by the general government. But, although
the latter cause still prevails to some degree, I have little
doubt that the average mortality among the frontier tribes,
at present, is less than it was before their removal.</p>

<p>To each tribe has generally been granted a greater number
of acres, with definite metes and boundaries, than had
been ceded by them east of the Mississippi. It is deemed
unnecessary, however, to swell this brief notice with a statement
of the several amounts of land given to each tribe,
and their localities, as these may be seen with sufficient
accuracy and definiteness by consulting the map which
accompanies this work.</p>

<p>The lands of each tribe are the property of the Indian
commonwealth; and, therefore, even among the most
civilized of them, the settler has a title only in his improvement,
which he holds by occupancy, and can sell at pleasure.
To prevent collisions in improvements, the first occupant
is entitled to a certain distance in every direction. Among
the Cherokees, no one can build within a quarter of a mile
of the house or field of another: so, to extend their possessions,
the more wealthy sometimes make several isolated
improvements, scattered in different directions, within half
a mile of each other. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg303"></a>[p303]</span></p>

<p>{258} The game in the interspersed forests having now
become scarce, and that of the western prairies being too
remote, the frontier Indians have generally turned their
attention to agriculture, and to the raising of stock; and
most of them have large numbers of horses, cattle, and
hogs.</p>

<p>Some of these Indians, particularly of the southern nations,
have very extensive farms: but the mass of their population
extend their culture no further than they seem compelled
by necessity. The traveller, passing through the Cherokee
Nation, is struck with the contrast between an occasional
stately dwelling, with an extensive farm attached, and the
miserable hovels of the indigent, sometimes not ten feet
square, with a little patch of corn, scarce large enough for
a family garden. In fact, among all the tribes who have
no slaves, what little there is of cultivation, is mostly the
work of the women. Scattered through the country, one
continually encounters dilapidated huts with trifling improvements,
which have been abandoned by the owners
for some fancy they may have taken to some other location
at a distance, better adapted, as they think, to the promotion
of their comfort, and upon which they may live
with less labor.</p>

<p>Most of the labor among the wealthier classes of Cherokees,
Choctaws, Chickasaws, Creeks and Seminoles, is
done by negro slaves; for they have all adopted substantially
the Southern system of slavery.<a name="FNanchor_192_193" id="FNanchor_192_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_193" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Some individuals
of these nations own over fifty slaves each: {259} but they <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg304"></a>[p304]</span>
are the only slaveholders of the frontier tribes, except very
few among the Shawnees.</p>

<p>With some tribes, and particularly among the lower
classes of the Creeks, they are inclined to settle in 'towns,'
as they are called,—making large fields, which are cultivated
in common, and the produce proportionally distributed.
But these 'towns' are rather settlements than
villages, being but sparse clusters of huts without any
regularity. Indeed, there is not, I believe, a regularly
laid out town in all the Indian country, nor a place that
could even merit the name of a village; except Doaksville
near Fort Towson, and perhaps Park Hill in the Cherokee
Nation.<a name="FNanchor_193_194" id="FNanchor_193_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_194" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Besides agriculture, most of the frontier tribes attend
a little to manufactures, though with no greater energy.
The women have generally learned to spin, weave and
sew, at which they occupy themselves, occasionally, during
recess from the labors of the field. But very few of the
men acquire mechanical arts or follow trades of any kind:
their carpenter, wheelwright and smith work is done by
a few mechanics provided the several tribes in accordance
with treaty stipulations. To each tribe is furnished in
particular one or more blacksmiths from the United States.</p>

<p>These frontier Indians for the most part live in cabins
of logs, like those of our backwoods settlers; and many of
them are undistinguishable, except in color, language,
and to some degree in costume, from the poorer {260}
classes of their white neighbors. Even in dress and
language the more civilized are fast conforming to the latter.
In many families, especially of the Cherokees, the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg305"></a>[p305]</span>
English tongue only is spoken; and great numbers of these,
as well as of the Choctaws and Chickasaws, dress according
to the American fashions: but the ruder portions of even
these, the most enlightened nations, as is also the case
with nearly all of the northern tribes, wear the hunting-shirt,
sometimes of buckskin, but now more commonly
of calico, cotton plaid or linsey. Instead of using hats,
they wreathe about their heads a fancy-colored shawl or
handkerchief. Neither do the women of these classes
wear bonnets, but leave their heads exposed, or protected
only with a shawl, somewhat after the manner of the Mexican
females; to the lower classes of whom, indeed, the
mixed-bloods of these Indians bear a strong resemblance.
Their most usual dress is a short petticoat of cotton goods,
or as frequently with the tribes of the north, of coarse red
or blue broad-cloth.</p>

<p>The literary opportunities afforded to the border tribes
are so important in their consequences as to deserve some
notice. To each tribe has been granted, by the United
States, a school fund, generally somewhat proportioned
to the extent of the tribe. The Cherokees and Choctaws
seem to have availed themselves of this provision to the
greatest advantage. These funds are for the most part
invested in American stocks, and the proceeds {261} appropriated
to educational uses, establishing schools, etc.<a name="FNanchor_194_195" id="FNanchor_194_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_195" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg306"></a>[p306]</span>
The tuition is, I believe, in every case, free to the Indians;
and yet it is painful to know that comparatively few of the
common classes will send their children.</p>

<p>The most extensive literary institution which has ever
been in operation, for the benefit of the 'red man,' was
the 'Choctaw Academy,' established in Kentucky, and
supported by a common fund of several different tribes.
It was not as successful, however, as was anticipated by
its projectors; and is now being transferred and merged
into an academy near Fort Towson, in the Choctaw country,
wholly supported out of the Choctaw fund. This Academy
proved very unsatisfactory to many of the tribes concerned.
They said, with apparent justice, that their boys, educated
there, forgot all their customs, their language, their relatives,
their national attachments; and, in exchange, often
acquired indolent and effeminate, if not vicious habits;
and were rendered {262} unfit to live among their people,
or to earn a maintenance by labor. There seems but little
doubt that the funds of each tribe might be employed to a
much better advantage in their own country. The influence
of the institutions would there be more likely to
extend to all classes; and by gradual, the only practicable
means, a change might be wrought upon the nation.<a name="FNanchor_195_196" id="FNanchor_195_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_196" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>It is one of the calamities incident to the state of ignorance
in which most of these poor Indians remain, and their close,
indeed political connection with the more civilized people <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg307"></a>[p307]</span>
of the United States, that they are continually preyed upon
by the unprincipled harpies who are ever prowling through
their country, ready to seize every opportunity of deceiving
and defrauding them out of their money or effects.<a name="FNanchor_196_197" id="FNanchor_196_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_197" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> {263}
The most depraving agencies employed to this end are
the ministration of intoxicating drinks, and gaming, of
both which the Indians are passionately fond, and by
which they are frequently robbed of their money as soon
almost as received.</p>

<p>Apart from the usual games at cards, dice, etc., the Indians
of the border have some peculiar games of their own, as
well at cards as otherwise. Among these the most celebrated
is the 'Ball Play,' which resembles, in some respects,
the old-fashioned game of <dfn>bandy</dfn>. The wagers are usually
laid upon beating the majority of a given number, a dozen
or more of these games; and large amounts in horses,
blankets, and other goods, and even money, are frequently
staked upon the result.</p>

<p>Besides the ball play, <i>dancing</i> is a most favorite amusement
of these tribes, indeed of all the frontier as well as
prairie Indians. They formerly had many kinds of dances,—the
green-corn dance, the medicine, the eagle, the scalp
and the war dances. But these are now only practised
by the ruder portions of the border nations and the less
improved tribes; among whom may still be witnessed
frequently their genuine aboriginal frolics. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg308"></a>[p308]</span></p>

<p>The green-corn dance generally lasts several {264} days,
commencing when the new crop begins to ripen. A large
arbor of green branches is usually prepared, and numerous
parties of both sexes dance in a body to their native songs
and rude instrumental music, accompanied by their monotonous
"heh! heh! heh!" with a chorus of yells at intervals;
and their movements are attended with the most comical
gesticulations. Having passed through a course of 'purification'
by drinking a decoction of certain stimulant herbs,
prepared by their medicine-men, and put out all the fires,
they strike fire anew by rubbing sticks together; and a
quantity of corn, pulse and other fruits of the season, being
cooked with the 'new fire,' the dance is closed with a general
feast. Each family, as it is said, then takes a supply from
the 'new breed' of fire. A more interesting and salutary
influence of this custom, which is said to prevail among
some tribes at this festival, is the cancelling or composing
of all old difficulties and disputes.</p>

<p>The most advanced of these border nations, the <i>Cherokees</i>
and the united tribes of the <i>Choctaws</i> and <i>Chickasaws</i>,
have adopted systems of government, which are based upon <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg309"></a>[p309]</span>
the constitutions of our States. The Cherokee being the
most complete, some account of it may not be out of place
in this connection.</p>

<p>A council or convention of the wise men of the nation
was convened on the first of July, 1839, who framed a
constitution, of which the following are the general features,
it being somewhat similar to one previously adopted in
{265} the 'Old Nation.' The three powers, legislative,
executive and judicial, are distinguished and established.
The legislative consists of a National Committee and
Council. The former is composed of two and the latter
of three members from each of the eight or ten districts
into which the nation was to be divided—elected for two
years by the people. They convene annually on the first
Monday in October, and each house elects a presiding
officer out of its own body. Bills are introduced, discussed
and passed according to parliamentary usage.</p>

<p>The executive, called Principal Chief, and an assistant
chief, are elected for four years by the people. The executive
has the usual veto and pardoning power. He is assisted
by an 'Executive Council' of five, and the common
cabinet of secretaries. The judiciary consists of a Supreme
and Circuit Court, and the ordinary justices of the peace.
Trial by jury is secured; and the common law of England
appears to have been generally adopted. Religious toleration
is guarantied, but no person can hold a civil office who
denies the existence of a God, and a future state of rewards
and punishments.<a name="FNanchor_197_198" id="FNanchor_197_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_198" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>According to laws subsequently enacted by the same
council, the punishment for murder is death; and for an
attempt to kill, a fine correspondent to the damage, for the
benefit of the injured party: for rape, a hundred lashes—but <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg310"></a>[p310]</span>
for infanticide, only twenty-five to fifty!<a name="FNanchor_198_199" id="FNanchor_198_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_199" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Whipping
seems the punishment {266} for all inferior crimes; which
is the same with the Choctaws and Creeks, among whom
the executioners are called the 'light-horse,' a kind of
police-guard, also formerly in use by the Cherokees, but
now their place is supplied by a common sheriff and <i>posse</i>.</p>

<p>As is to be inferred from their institutions, the Cherokees
stand first among the 'red men' in refinement, though in
industry, morality, and sobriety, they are no doubt excelled
by the Choctaws and Chickasaws, who are reckoned the
most quiet and Christian-like Indians of the border.</p>

<p>No laws have yet been passed to enforce the payment of
debts, except by the Cherokees; and these found it necessary
to suspend their operation for two years. Even the
most improved have not prohibited polygamy by any law;
though, from the example of the whites and of the more
civilized among them, as well as the exertions of the missionaries,
it is growing out of repute with most of the border
nations. It is still occasionally practised, however; and
the ruder classes among them all, I believe, sometimes still
take any number of wives, and divorce them at pleasure.
But the more enlightened are married by preachers, or
authorized civil officers.</p>

<p>With the united nation of Choctaws and Chickasaws,
the executive power is vested in four chiefs, called in Choctaw
<dfn>mingoes</dfn>, who are selected one from each of the districts
into which the country is divided, {267} and of which the
Chickasaw tribe constitutes one.<a name="FNanchor_199_200" id="FNanchor_199_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_200" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> These chiefs are vested
with the usual veto and pardoning powers, and are elected <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg311"></a>[p311]</span>
for four years. Most of their other constitutional provisions
resemble those of the Cherokees. The Choctaws,
as well as the Creeks, punish the crime of murder with
death by shooting, which is generally executed immediately
after trial, by the 'light-horse.'</p>

<p>It has become evident, however, that written laws and
courts of justice, judges and juries, are still rather in advance
of the state of civilization of the ruder classes, even
among these most enlightened tribes. It has been found
very difficult to bring them under their subordination.
They have had, notwithstanding, a salutary effect in many
cases, and especially with regard to murder. Among
most of these nations (as well as the wild tribes), it was
formerly the custom to leave the punishment of homicide
to the relatives of the murdered. With the Choctaws
and Cherokees, in particular, the entire clan or
family of the murderer were held responsible for the crime;
and though the real offender might escape, the bereaved
family had a right to kill any one of his nearest relatives
that could be found, up to the most remote kindred. There
seemed no exceptions for accidental homicide, or killing
in self-defence: the Mosaic precept of 'life for life' must
be fulfilled, unless satisfactorily commuted. This savage
custom had at least one salutary effect, however: the relatives
themselves, instead of assisting {268} the escape, as
so often occurs in civilized life, were generally the first
to apprehend and bring the fugitive criminal to justice.</p>

<p>But among the Choctaws, at least, any one might take
the place of the murderer, and in the death of the substitute
the law was satisfied, and the true criminal remained exempt.
An intelligent and creditable Choctaw related to
me an affecting incident, for the truth of which he vouched.
An Indian had remained responsible for the appearance,
on a certain day, of his brother, who had killed a man. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg312"></a>[p312]</span>
When the day arrived, the murderer exhibited some reluctance
to fulfil the pledge, when the other said to him: "My
brother, you are no brave—you are afraid to die—stay
here and take care of my family—I will die in your place:"
whereupon he immediately attended the appointed spot,
and was executed accordingly.</p>

<p>The highest honor known among them, in fact, being
that of a 'great brave,' it reflected the greatest credit to
meet death boldly. Instead of being visited by his tribe
with infamy for the crime he had committed, it rather
tended to make his name illustrious, if he met the consequences
without fear or flinching: whereas, any effort to
avoid death was attributed to cowardice. It would have
been esteemed quite as ignominious for the murderer to
flee the established forfeit of his life, as for a 'gentleman'
under the 'civilized code of honor,' to back out from a
duel.</p>

<p>But among most of the frontier, as also the {269} wild
tribes, a commutation, though not honorable to the perpetrator,
was and still is permitted, except by the Cherokees
and Choctaws. Any recompense which would satisfy the
bereft family, released the murderer from further penalty.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any temptation which the Indian
tribes have to encounter so frequently, and so seriously
fatal to their social improvement, as intemperance. Of
this they are conscious themselves, and most of them have
adopted measures for prohibiting the introduction of ardent
spirits among them, and for checking the propensity to
use them, with various degrees of success. Among the
Choctaws, a law was passed upon this subject, which,
though not entirely, was measurably successful; and the
spirit which effected its passage was worthy of the most
exalted state of civilization.</p>

<p>It seems that the tribe had generally become sensible <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg313"></a>[p313]</span>
of the pernicious influences of strong drink upon their
prosperity and happiness, and had attempted various
plans for its suppression, without success. At last, it was
determined by the chiefs, captains, and head men, to strike
a blow which should reach the very root of the evil at once.
A council was called, and many and long were the speeches
which were made, and much enthusiasm was created
against the monster 'Whiskey,' and all his brood of compound
enormities. Still every one seemed loth to move
his arrest and execution. Finally, a {270} captain of more
than ordinary temerity arose, and offered a resolution that
each and every individual who should thenceforward dare to
introduce any of the liquid curses into their country, should
be punished with a hundred lashes on his bare back, and
the liquor be poured out. This was passed, after some
slight changes, by acclamation: but, with a due sense of
the injustice of <i>ex-post-facto</i> restrictions, all those who had
liquors on hand were permitted to sell them. The council
adjourned; but the members soon began to canvass among
each other the pernicious consequences which might result
from the protracted use of the whiskey already in the shops,
and therefore concluded the quicker it was drank up, the
more promptly would the evil be over: so, falling to, in less
than two hours Bacchus never mustered a drunker troop
than were these same temperance legislators. The consequences
of their determination were of lasting importance
to them. The law, with some slight improvements, has ever
since been rigorously enforced.</p>

<p>Among most of the Indian tribes the daughter has very
little to do with the selection of her husband. The parents
usually require to be satisfied first, and their permission
being secured the daughter never presumes to offer any
important resistance. There is a post-nuptial custom
peculiar to the full-blood Indians of the Choctaws, which <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg314"></a>[p314]</span>
deserves particular notice. For years, and perhaps for
life, {271} after the marriage of her daughter, the mother
is forbidden to look upon her son-in-law. Though they
converse together, he must be hidden from her by a
wall, a tent, a curtain, or, when nothing else offers, by
covering the eyes. During their emigration, it is said
these poor superstitious matrons were put to infinite trouble
so as not to infract this custom. While travelling, or in
camp often without tents, the mother-in-law was afraid to
raise her head or open her eyes, lest they should meet the
interdicted object.</p>

<p>It is another peculiarity, which they have in common
with some of the more northern tribes, that the Choctaw
wife, of the 'old school,' can never call her husband by
name. But if they have offspring—she calls him "my
son's father;" or, more commonly using the child's name,
when, if Ok-le-no-wa, for instance, she calls the husband
"Ok-le-no-wa's father." And yet another oddity regarding
names: the ignorant Choctaw seems to have a superstitious
aversion to telling his own name: indeed it appears
impossible to get it from him, unless he have an acquaintance
present, whom he will request to tell it for him.</p>

<p>In burials, the civilized Choctaws follow the customs of
the whites, but the ruder classes still preserve their aboriginal
usages. According to these, a painted pole with a
flag is stuck up at the grave, which usually remains three
months. During this period they have regular mourning
exercises every morning and evening; and are always prompt
to avail themselves, {272} at any other hour of the day, of
the assistance of any friend who may visit them to help
them to weep. At the end of the prescribed term, the
friends of the bereft family attend a feast at their house,
and, after dancing all night, the next morning visit the
grave and pull down the pole; which is called 'the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg315"></a>[p315]</span>
pole-pulling.' After this all mourning ceases, and the family
is permitted to join in the usual amusements and festivities
of the tribe, which was not allowable before.</p>

<p>Though the <i>Creeks</i><a name="FNanchor_200_201" id="FNanchor_200_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_201" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> are generally a very industrious
people, raising an abundance of corn and vegetables, yet
they are quite behind their neighbors, of whom I have been
speaking, as well politically as in a social and literary view.
Their executive consists of two principal chiefs, and their
legislature or council of about forty minor chiefs or captains,
who are also, <i>ex officio</i>, justices of the peace.<a name="FNanchor_201_202" id="FNanchor_201_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_202" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> They
have no trial by jury, and their judicial proceedings are
exceedingly summary—frequently without witnesses; for
the warriors are generally too proud to deny a charge, lest
it be construed into cowardice. Executions sometimes
take place within an hour after the commencement of trial.
Murder, rape and a third conviction of stealing are punished
with death, usually by shooting; but, in case of homicide,
if claimed by the relatives of the {273} deceased, the criminal
is executed with the same kind of weapon, or, if possible,
the very same, with which he committed the murder.</p>

<p>Most inferior crimes, as has been mentioned, are punished
by whipping: for the first offence of stealing, fifty
lashes; for the second, a hundred and ears cropped. Adultery
is punished by cutting off both the nose and ears of
the adulteress; but the husband has a right to say if the
law shall be executed: in fact, he is generally the executioner,
and that often without trial. Notwithstanding
the severity of these laws, they are for the most part rigorously
enforced; though a commutation satisfactory to the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg316"></a>[p316]</span>
aggrieved is still permitted to release the offender. Their
laws, in cases of accidental homicide, are still more barbarously
rigid than those of the other nations.</p>

<p>The obsequies of the Creeks are peculiar in this,—that
at the moment an Indian expires, a gun is discharged.
Their graves are generally under the floors of their dwellings,
and a husband's is apt to be under the bed of his
widow. The fate of the unfortunate relict is miserable
enough in any country, but among the Creeks her doom
is barbarously rigorous. She remains in strict mourning
for four years,<a name="FNanchor_202_203" id="FNanchor_202_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_203" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> with dishevelled hair and without {274}
combing,—unless the relatives of the deceased interfere;
whereby it is sometimes put an end to in a few months,
provided the sincerity of her grief be evident and her conduct
meritorious. In their mourning, however, they do
not weep and cry with such clamorous vehemence as the
Choctaws and others. But the Shawnees and Delawares
are still more celebrated for quiet mourning.<a name="FNanchor_203_204" id="FNanchor_203_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_204" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> As warlike
nations, they appear to disdain to mourn and wail aloud,
as is the practice among the greater portion of the savage
tribes.</p>

<p>Though these people have no family names, they generally
take a kind of honorary title or <i>sobriquet</i>, as is also the
case with the wild tribes, upon the occurrence of any important
incident, or the performance of a meritorious feat.
A singular mode of inheritance prevails among the Cherokees,
the Creeks, and perhaps others. Though the women
in other respects are mostly held as very inferior beings,
the clans are all reckoned by them: the children pertain to <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg317"></a>[p317]</span>
the mother, and the estates descend through the female
branch of the family. They say it is easy enough to verify
the mothers of families, but it is difficult to identify the
fathers.</p>

<p>The remaining tribes, inhabiting the more northern
frontier, as well as the Seminoles who are located among
the Creeks, possess so few distinct or striking characteristics,
and, indeed, are mostly so few in number, that a particular
notice of them seems hardly to be required. Suffice it to
say, that all of them, {275} as I believe, still retain their
ancient systems of arbitrary chiefs and councils of sages
and braves, nearly in their primitive state; and that the
greater portion of them live in log huts, and cultivate the
soil to a considerable extent. Though the Shawnees,
Delawares, and Kickapoos, are among the most agricultural
of the northern Indians, yet a few of these spend the
greater portion of their time on the Prairies in hunting and
in trading with the wild tribes.<a name="FNanchor_204_205" id="FNanchor_204_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_205" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_179_180" id="Footnote_179_180"></a><a href="#FNanchor_179_180"><span class="label">[179]</span></a> The Shawnees have four missionary establishments among them, viz. a
Methodist, Baptist, Moravian, and Quaker. There are also missionaries of different
sects among most of the tribes of the border, the labors of whom have been
attended with some degree of success. There is, I believe, but one Catholic Mission
upon the frontier, which is among the Potawatomies, about a thousand of whom
have embraced this faith. The Catholics, however, appear to have succeeded
better than most other denominations, in their missionary efforts. It is so in Mexico,
so in Canada, and appears so everywhere else that they have undertaken the Christianization
of the heathen. I would not be understood to attribute this to any
intrinsic superiority of their religion, but to the peculiarities of its forms and ceremonies.
The pageantry of their worship, the palpable representation of the
divine mysteries by the introduction of images, better accords with their pristine
idolatry, than a more spiritual faith. Catholics, indeed, have had the sagacity
to permit the Indians (at least in some countries) to interweave many of their
own heathen ceremonies with the sacred Christian rites, forming a singular <i>mêlée</i>
of Romish and pagan worship, which is especially the case in Mexico. Also, the
less rigid Catholic creed and customs do not debar them from their wonted favorite
amusements, not to say vices. It is therefore that whole tribes sometimes simultaneously
embrace this imposing creed.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span></p></div>

auncient an Astronomer, knowethe the tymes of thynges, and seeth howe they are
naturally directed:" to which he appends numerous instances of the evil spirit's
revelations of the "tymes of thynges to coome" to his ministers, the magi. And
even as late as 1721, Father Charlevoix gravely says, an instance he relates, and
many others that he "knows, which are equally certain, prove that the Devil is
sometimes concerned in the magic of the Savages." The Choctaws, and perhaps
some others, used to punish witchcraft with all the rigor of our own ancestors,
putting poor creatures to death upon the slightest proof of their tampering with
the black art: but this barbarity is now prohibited by their more civilized laws.
Yet the more barbarous tribes still have their conjurers and medicine-men, who
deal in auguries and mystic ceremonies; which, with their dances, constitute the
greater part of their worship.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span></p></div>

writers for me to enter into it here: nor will I attempt to show the general traits
of similarity that are to be observed in their various languages: yet it may interest
an occasional reader, to be informed of the relations of consanguinity which subsist
between many of the different Indian tribes. They may be arranged principally
under the following heads: 1. The Dahcotah stock, which is by far the most
extensive of those indigenous west of the Mississippi. It embraces the Arkansas
(of which the Quapaws are now the only remnant), the Osages, Kansas or Kaws,
Iowas, Winnebagoes, Otoes, Missouries, Omahas, Poncas, and the various bands
of the Sioux: all of whom speak a language still traceable to the same origin, though
some of them have been separated for several centuries. I call these indigenous
to the West, because most of them have been so from the period of the earliest
explorers on the Mississippi; yet the tradition among them is that they came from
about the northern lakes; which appears corroborated by the fact, that the language
of the Naudowessies, Assiniboins, and perhaps others in that quarter, shows them
to be of the same family.—2. The different bands of the Comanches and Shoshonies
or Snakes, constitute another extensive stock, speaking one language.—3. The
Blackfeet, Gros Ventres or Minnatarees, Crows and Arrapahoes, speak dialects
of another.—4. The Pawnees and Rickaras of the north, and the Wacoes, Wichitas,
Towockanoes, Towyash and Keechyes, of Red River, are of the same origin.
The Chayennes, originally from near Lake Winnipeg, and the Kiawas (or Caiguas,
according to Mexican orthography), appear unallied to any of the foregoing nations.—5.
Of those from the north and east, the Algonquin stock appears most extensive,—embracing
the Potawatomies, Ottawas, Chippewas, Knisteneaux, Crees,
Sacs and Foxes; with whom the Delawares have also been classed, though their
language would now appear very distinct.—6. The Wyandots, Senecas, and
others of the Six Nations, are of the Huron or Iroquois.—7. The Shawnees and
Kickapoos are of one stock.—8. The Kaskaskias, Piorias, Piankeshaws and
Weaws, are descendants of the Miamies.—9. The Choctaws and Chickasaws
are nearly the same people.—10. The Creeks and Seminoles—though old authors
speak of the Creeks as being akin to the Choctaws, yet there is now but little relationship
to be traced in their language; while that of the Cherokees appears
entirely <i>sui generis</i>.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span>

The <i>tribes</i> often take the names of the seceding chiefs
who originate them,
or are called from some circumstance attending their separation; but frequently
they assume a name from an important word in their languages: thus <i>Choctaw</i>
and <i>Chickasaw</i> are said to have been the names of chiefs; <dfn>Seminole</dfn> (or <i>Seminóleh</i>)
and <i>Pioria</i> imply runaways or seceders; while <i>Illinois</i>, in the language of that
ancient tribe, and <dfn>Lunnapáe</dfn>, by which the Delawares distinguish themselves,
signify <i>man</i>. This last is perhaps most common; for, as each nations holds itself
superior to all others, its members call themselves <i>men</i>, in contradistinction to
<i>boys</i> or <i>squaws</i>, as they are wont to denominate their enemies.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span></p></div>

migrate to the west of the Mississippi, a movement which began with detached
parties of Choctaw as early as 1805. In 1824 President Monroe recommended
their removal, and in 1830 Jackson ordered it. Large bands of these Indians had
already received lands in Arkansas; wherefore, in 1832, Indian Territory was set
apart for the tribes and removals thither began. The Choctaw, Chickasaw, and
Creek made but little difficulty; the Cherokee and Seminole opposed the removal.
The former were forcibly ejected (1836-38), and by 1839 were united on their
present site in Indian Territory. The Seminole resistance led to the war with
that people (1835-42), in which a large portion of the tribesmen perished. The
remainder were finally united in Indian Territory in 1846.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

Territory. At the outbreak of the War of Secession their sympathies were with
the Confederacy, with whom the Cherokee made a treaty October 7, 1861. Early
in 1863, however, they abolished slavery by law, and the large majority of their
regiments went over to the Union side. A constitutional amendment in 1866,
forever abolished slavery or involuntary servitude, except for crime. See <cite>Constitution

are often taught in their native languages. As in other respects, the Cherokees
have made the greatest advancement in a literary point. Their singular system
of characters representing syllables, invented by an illiterate native, is no doubt
known to most of my readers. In these characters, a considerable number of
books have been printed in their vernacular tongue. Many Cherokees, however,
as well as Choctaws, have received good English educations. In the language of
the latter also a great number of books have been published, but in which the common
letter is used. A few books have also been printed in the languages of the
Creeks, Wyandots, Potawatomies, and Ottawas, Shawnees, Delawares, and some
in the different dialects of Osage, Kansas, Otoes, etc. There is now a printing-office

year for twenty years was to be allotted for the use of schools. The Indians requested
that a portion of this fund might be used to educate boys at a distance
from home. This was a cherished plan of Colonel Richard M. Johnson, who was
chosen sponsor for the new academy, and began the erection of buildings near
his home at Great Crossings, in Scott County, Kentucky, where the first boys
were received in the autumn of 1825. Baptist co-operation was enlisted, and Rev.
Thomas Henderson chosen first principal of Choctaw Academy. At first the
school flourished, and Indian boys from many other tribes were sent to Kentucky,
until at one time the academy had an enrollment of more than one hundred and
fifty lads. In consequence of the dissatisfaction which Gregg here describes
the Choctaw and other Southern Indians began to withdraw their boys about 1842,
and the school's usefulness terminated. Consult <cite>House Ex. Docs.</cite>, 26 Cong.,
2 sess., 109. The civilized tribes now maintain several higher boarding schools
and academies in the territory. The Choctaw and Chickasaw each have five;

Indians, have been by contractors and government agents. The character of
these impositions may be inferred from the following instance, as it is told, and
very generally believed, upon the southwestern frontier.
</p>
<p>
It had been pretty well known, that some of those who had been in the habit
of contracting to furnish with subsistence several of the southern tribes, in the
year 1838 <i>et seq.</i>, had been imposing most grossly upon the Indians as well as the
Government, in the way of 'short rations' and other delinquencies, which resulted
in the gain of a very large sum to the parties concerned. About the close of their
operations, one of the <i>employés</i>, who was rather more cunning than the principals,
took it into his head, on account of some ill-treatment he had suffered, to make
an <i>exposé</i> of their transactions. He happened to hold a letter of instructions
(which were of course of a confidential character), wherein were set forth the
processes by which these frauds were to be practised. And to turn the affair
to his particular profit, he threatened the parties with a complete exposure, unless
a satisfactory <i>gratification</i> should interpose. A compromise being indispensable
to the welfare of 'all whom it concerned,' a negotiation was soon set on foot: but
the 'noisy customer' was not silenced, until he was paid $13,500 in cash; whereupon
he delivered up the obnoxious 'papers,' and agreed to abscond. Some
notice of the facts of this case are said to have been brought to the knowledge of
the Government; and how it has escaped an investigation—and, more especially,
how it escaped the attention of the Superintendent of that immediate district,
have been matters of great surprise to those who had a knowledge of the particulars.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span></p></div>

but the aggregate population of those settled west of the border, exclusive of the
Osages, Kansas, and others of the north (who are more appropriately ranked
among the Prairie Indians), is 76,664, according to the report of the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs for the year 1844. Of these there are reckoned of Cherokees,
25,911; Choctaws, 12,410; Chickasaws, 4,111; Creeks, 24,594; Seminoles, or Florida
Indians, 3,136; Senecas from Sandusky, 125; Senecas and Shawnees, 211; Quapaws,
400; Wyandots, 585; Potawatomies, Chippewas and Ottawas, located on the
waters of the Osage, 2,028; Kaskaskias and Piorias, 150; Piankeshaws, 98; Weaws,
176; Shawnees, 887; Delawares, 1,059; Stockbridges, Munsees, &#38;c., 278; Kickapoos,
505; In addition to these, there still remain east of the Mississippi, of Cherokees,
1,000; Choctaws, 7,000, (but which are now, January, 1845, in progress of
emigration); Chickasaws, 20; Creeks, 744; Potawatomies, &#38;c., 92; Weaws, 30;
besides some entire remnant tribes.
</p>
<p>
Many of the foregoing amounts, however, have been standing numbers in the
tables of the reports of the Indian Department, ever since the removal of these
tribes, and as it is known that most of them have been on the decline, the above
aggregate is no doubt excessive. For instance, instead of 25,911, as given in the
report for the Cherokees, their very intelligent agent, Governor Butler, reckoned
them, in 1842, at only about 18,000: the Creeks in place of 24,594, have, in like
manner, been set down at about 20,000; and in the 'Choctaw Almanac' for 1843, I
find the population of that nation rated at 12,690, instead of 15,177, as stated in
the Commissioner's report for the same year.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span></p></div></div>

<p>Those savage hordes which may be considered as the
Prairie Indians proper, have made little or no perceptible
progress in civilization. They mostly live by plunder
and the chase: a few eke out a subsistence by agriculture.
They consist of various distinct tribes, but among whom
there is a greater diversity of language than of habitudes.
I would not have it understood, however, that all the customs
of every band are entirely similar: it is this assumption,
together with the practice of setting down as standing
customs what they have observed on some particular occasions,
that has frequently created such a discrepancy between
the accounts of transient travellers.</p>

<p>{277} There is scarcely a prairie tribe, however limited
in numbers, but is subdivided into petty bands, each under
the immediate control of its own chief. Their systems of
government are frequently compounded of the patriarchal
and military. The most influential heads of families
exercise a petty rule, which often extends beyond their own
household to a circle of adherents. Several of these clans,
bound by the ties of consanguinity or friendship, are apt
to come under the control, by common consent, of some
more influential chief, who may have gained celebrity in
their wars; but a regular hereditary descent seems rarely
established. These petty bands seldom unite under one
general leader, except for the common defence, when <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg319"></a>[p319]</span>
threatened with danger. Occasionally there springs up a
master spirit—a great brave and a great sage, who is able
to unite his whole tribe, in which he is generally aided by
a sufficient knack at sorcerous tricks to give him the character
of a great 'medicine-man.'</p>

<p>War seems to be the element of the prairie Indians,
notwithstanding but few possess much intrinsic bravery.
They are, in fact, the most cowardly savages east of the
Rocky Mountains, bearing but little similitude in this
respect to the aborigines of the interior of the United States.
They rarely attack an enemy except with a decided advantage;
for the prospect of losing even a single warrior will
often deter them from undertaking the most flattering
adventure. It is true that, in addition {278} to their timidity,
they are restrained by the fact that the loss of a man often
casts a gloom upon the most brilliant victory, and throws
a whole clan into mourning. On this account they generally
attack by surprise, and in the night, when all are presumed
to be asleep; having care, if against a formidable enemy,
that it be long enough before the morning dawn to allow
them to retire beyond reach of pursuit before daylight.
When the moon rises at a late hour, just before she appears,
is a favorite time; for then they will have a gleam of light
by which to collect and drive off the prize of stock which
they may be able to frighten away. These prowling parties
around a camp sometimes employ a species of signals in
imitation of wolves, owls and other nocturnal animals, by
which they communicate with each other—mimicking
so to the life as not to give alarm to unsuspecting travellers.</p>

<p>War is seldom concluded upon, or even a campaign
undertaken, without a general council, in which all the
chiefs and most distinguished braves and sages assemble.
After all are seated in a circle, the pipe is passed around
until their brains are sufficiently soothed to enable them <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg320"></a>[p320]</span>
to consult the Great Spirit, and take freely into advisement
the important matters under consideration. Therefore the
tobacco smoke is usually blown upwards, as a propitiatory
incense to the invoked spirits or genii who dwell 'upon the
sky.' In this operation the smoke is generally inhaled
into {279} the lungs, and discharged in murky streams
from the olfactories. If a council be preparatory to a campaign,
the warriors sometimes catch the tobacco smoke
in the hand, anointing their bodies with it; which they
fancy renders them, if not invulnerable, at least far more
secure from the darts of their enemies.</p>

<p>Although in their warfare they employ every wile and
stratagem, and faithless subterfuge, to deceive their enemies,
and in battle are relentless and cruel in the extreme, yet
they seldom resort to those horrid punishments and tortures
upon their prisoners which were wont to be inflicted
by the savages of the interior of the United States, during
their early wars with the whites. The practice of burning
their captives alive, said to have prevailed many years ago
among some prairie tribes, seems now to have grown quite
out of use.</p>

<p>Upon returning from a campaign after a defeat, the
village resounds for many days with the lamentations, the
shrieks and wailings of the women and children; in which,
not only the bereft families, but all the relatives and most
of the friends of the deceased join. If, on the contrary, the
warriors have been successful, and bring home scalps of
their enemies, all join in their most famous festival, the
scalp-dance. In this fête the savage trophies are usually
elevated upon a pole in the centre of the dance; or perhaps
the brave captors retain them in their hands, tossing and
swinging them about their heads; at the same time vehemently
apostrophizing these ghastly representatives {280}
of their enemies, with the most taunting and insulting <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg321"></a>[p321]</span>
bravadoes; branding the nation with cowardice and effeminacy;
daring them to come forward and revenge the
blood of their slain; then concluding with scoffs and exulting
yells at the dastardly silence of their enemies, whom
they represent as afraid to whisper a note of vengeance
against their superiors and masters, the triumphing conquerors.
After the warriors have become fatigued, the
squaws and children generally continue the barbarous
festivity; in the midst of which some vainglorious brave
will rise perhaps, and repeat the apostrophic fanfaronades,
representing that the very squaws and papooses hold them
in cowering submission, and that henceforth these only
will be sent to subdue them; their warriors being reserved
for more noble enemies. These brutal rites and rodomontades
being concluded, the scalps are handed to their
owners, who cure and paint them for future war-dances
and other kindred ceremonies.</p>

<p>When a tribe wishes to celebrate a treaty of peace with
an enemy, a number of their warriors, as ambassadors, or
perhaps a whole band, move to the neighborhood, and
send the calumet or pipe of peace, which supplies the place
of the flag of truce among civilized nations:<a name="FNanchor_205_206" id="FNanchor_205_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_206" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> though, when
the embassy {281} is to the whites, a flag usually accompanies,
as they have learned that this is our token of peace.
The overture being accepted, the chiefs and principals of
each band meet in council, sometimes in a wigwam, if there <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg322"></a>[p322]</span>
be a suitable one, else in the open air, taking their seats,
as usual, upon their haunches in a circle proportioned to
the number. If there be presents—and these are an
indispensable earnest of friendship from the whites—the
essence, the seal of the treaty, without which negotiation
is vain—these are laid in the centre. A personage in the
capacity of an orderly sergeant then lights the calumet,
which he hands to a principal chief, who, before smoking,
usually points the stem towards the four cardinal points,
and towards the heavens and the earth—then takes
a certain number of whiffs (generally about three), and
passing it to the next, who draws an equal number of
whiffs, it thus continues around the circle, in the direction
of the sun, each sending fumid {282} currents upward from
the nozzle. It seems looked upon as sacrilege for a person
to pass before the pipe while the chiefs are smoking; and
the heedless or impudent are sometimes severely punished
for the act. The 'big talk' follows, and the presents are
distributed by a chief who exercises the office of commissary.
But in the petty truces among each other, presents
are scarcely expected, except they be claimed by the more
powerful party as a matter of tribute.</p>

<p>Travellers and hunters are generally obliged to hold a
treaty or 'big talk' with every band of prairie Indians they
may encounter, if they wish to maintain friendly relations
with them. Treaties have also been held, at different
periods, with most of the wild tribes, by agents of the U. S. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg323"></a>[p323]</span>
Government, yet for the most part with but very little effect—they
generally forget or disregard them by the time
the presents they may have received are consumed.</p>

<p>These treaties, as well as other council deliberations,
are generally promulgated by a sort of public crier, who
proclaims the stipulations and resolutions from lodge to
lodge; and the event is preserved in the memory of the
sages to future generations. Among some of the tribes
their memory is assisted by the famous 'wampum belt,'
which is a list or belt made of wampum beads, so interwoven
in hieroglyphic figures as to form a record of important
events. Others preserve the same by hieroglyphic
paintings on their buffalo rugs, and the like.</p>

<p>{283} The <i>arms</i> of the wild Indians are chiefly the bow
and arrows, with the use of which they become remarkably
expert. A dexterous savage will lay a wager, at short
shots, against many riflemen. Indeed, there is hardly
any more effective weapon than the bow and arrow in the
hands of an expert archer. While the musketeer will load
and fire once, the bowman will discharge a dozen arrows,
and that, at distances under fifty yards, with an accuracy
nearly equal to the rifle. In a charge, they are eminently
serviceable; for the Indian seems to discharge his arrows
with about as much certainty when running at full speed
as when standing.</p>

<p>The usual length of the Indian bow is about three feet,
though it is sometimes as much as four. It is generally
made of elastic wood, yet elk's horn is occasionally used.
Those of the latter are made of two of the longest and
straightest shafts, which, being shaved down to the necessary
proportions, are united by lapping their ends together
and binding them firmly with sinew. Bows have also
been made, in the same manner, of a pair of buffalo ribs;
but as well these as those of elk-horn, are rather items of <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg324"></a>[p324]</span>
curiosity than of service: at least, they are not equal to bows
of the bois-d'arc tree. Even the backs of the <i>wooden</i> bows
are often lined the whole length with a broad strip of sinew,
and the whole wrapped with shreds of the same. The
arrows are generally about thirty inches long, and pointed
with iron, though the primitive {284} flint points are still
met with among some of the wildest tribes.</p>

<p>Besides these, the lance or spear, the use of which they
may have learned from the Mexicans, is an effective weapon
in the charge as well as the chase. Many are also provided
with the Northwestern fusil, and some have rifles. Very
few, however, have acquired the dexterity of our frontier
Indians with this deadly weapon. But no Indian deems
his equipage complete without a 'scalping-knife;' yet
among the western prairie Indians the tomahawk is but
little known. These employ, in its stead, the war-club
or 'war-hawk,' which are bludgeons with an encased stone
for a head in the former, and with a transverse blade or
spike in its place in the latter. Many are provided with
shields of raw buffalo or elk skin, upon which are frequently
painted some rude hieroglyphical devices representing the
enemies they have slain, as well as any other notable exploits
of which they can boast. Such as are without these
have their titles to renown recorded commonly upon the
handles of their hatchets, their war-clubs, or perhaps tattooed
upon their breasts or arms.</p>

<p>Besides war, <i>hunting</i> seems the only creditable employment
in which a warrior can engage. Every other labor
is put upon the squaws; and even when a party of hunters
set out, they generally provide themselves with enough of
these 'menials' to take charge of the meat: the Indian
only deigns to shoot {285} down the game; the squaws
not only have it to cure and pack, but to skin and dress. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg325"></a>[p325]</span></p>

<p>Except such tribes as are expert with the rifle, very few
of the prairie Indians hunt other game than the buffalo:
not, as some have presumed, because they deem all small
game too ignoble for them, but because the former is at
once easiest taken, and affords the most bounteous supply
of food. The antelope is too wild and fleet for their mode
of hunting, and is only occasionally taken by stratagem;
while the deer, as difficult to take in the chase, is less easily
entrapped. But, mounted upon their trained steeds, and
with the arrow or lance, they are not to be excelled in the
chase. A few of them, let loose among a herd of buffalo,
will soon have the plain strewed with their carcasses.</p>

<p>Among the amusements of the Indians generally, <i>dancing</i>
is perhaps the most favorite. Besides a war accompaniment,
it is practised as a recreation, and often connected
with their worship. Their social frolics, in which the
squaws are commonly permitted to join, are conducted
with less ferocity of manner than their war dances; though
even these are accompanied with the wildest and most
comical gesticulations, and songs full at once of mirth
and obscenity. In these, as well as in the war and scalp
dances, a sort of little drum and a shrill squeaking pipe
are their common instruments of music.</p>

<p>As so many tongues, entirely different, are spoken by
the prairie Indians, a 'language of {286} signs' has become
the general medium of communication between the different
nations. This system of signs has been brought to such perfection
among them, that the most intricate correspondence
seems to be intelligibly conducted by such as have acquired
a proficiency in this 'dumb language.'</p>

<p>Their systems of telegraphs are very peculiar, and though
they might seem impracticable at first, yet so thoroughly
are they understood by the savages, that it is availed of <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg326"></a>[p326]</span>
frequently to immense advantage. The most remarkable
is by raising smokes, by which many important facts are
communicated to a considerable distance—and made
intelligible by the manner, size, number or repetition of the
smokes, which are commonly raised by firing spots of dry
grass. When travelling, they will also pile heaps of stones
upon mounds or conspicuous points, so arranged as to be
understood by their passing comrades; and sometimes
they set up the bleached buffalo heads, which are everywhere
scattered over those plains, to indicate the direction
of their march, and many other facts which may be communicated
by those simple signs.</p>

<p>Almost every tribe has some peculiarity in the construction
of their lodges or wigwams, in the manner of arranging
their camps, and in the different items of dress,
by any or all which peculiarities the experienced traveller
is able to recognize the tribe of their owner. If a moccasin,
or other article of apparel be {287} found, he at once
designates the nation to which it belongs—even a track
is often sufficient to identify them.<a name="FNanchor_206_207" id="FNanchor_206_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_207" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Also by the 'sign,'
and especially the remains of fires, he determines the interval
elapsed since their departure, with remarkable accuracy.</p>

<p>The lodges are composed of a frame of small poles or
rods, covered usually with buffalo skins, which receive but
little further preparation than the currying off of the hair.
Some give their lodges a round wagon-top shape, as those
of the Osages, which commonly consist of a frame of bent
rods, resembling wagon-bows, and covered with skins,
the bark of trees, or, as is generally the case in their villages,
with grass and earth. Again, some dispose the poles in
two parallel lines, and incline them against a ridge-pole, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg327"></a>[p327]</span>
which gives the wigwam the shape of a house-roof: others,
planting small rods in a circle, to swine the points together
as to resemble, in some degree, when covered, a rounded
hay-mow: but by far the most general style, among the
wild tribes, of constructing their wigwams, is by planting
the lodge-poles so as to enclose a circular area of from ten
to twenty feet in diameter (the size depending upon the
number of the family); and the tops being brought together,
it forms a conical frame, which is closely covered with
skins, except an aperture in the apex for the escape of the
{288} smoke. This is the style of the Comanches and most
other tribes of the great plains. The doors of the lodges
being closed with a skin, they are kept very comfortable
in winter with but little fire. This is kindled in the centre,
and a hole is left in the vertex of the lodge, through which
the smoke is discharged so freely, that the interior is but
seldom infected by it.</p>

<p>These lodges are always pitched or set up by the squaws,
and with such expedition, that, upon the stopping of an
itinerant band, a town springs up in a desert valley in a
few minutes, as if by enchantment. The lodge-poles are
often neatly prepared, and carried along from camp to
camp. In conveying them, one end frequently drags on
the ground; whereby the trail is known to be that of a band
with families, as war parties never carry lodge-poles. The
Chayennes, Sioux and some other northern tribes, often
employ dogs for carrying and dragging their lodge covers
and poles; indeed for conveying most of their light baggage:
but, for ordinary travelling purposes and packing their
more weighty baggage, they use horses. So few navigable
waters traverse the Prairies, that none of the Indians of
the high plains have learned the use of canoes or water-craft
of any kind.</p>

<p>There is some variety in the dress in vogue among the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg328"></a>[p328]</span>
different tribes; though they all use moccasins, leggins,
flap or breech-clout, and, when not in active pursuits,
they generally wrap their bodies in buffalo rugs, blankets
or {289} mantles of strouding, according to their wealth
or opportunities. Some of the northern tribes display
considerable ingenuity and taste in the manufacture of
moccasins. But this is the work of the women, who often
embroider them with beads and colored porcupine quills,
in a most beautiful manner. The <dfn>leggin</dfn> is a buckskin
or cloth covering for the leg and thigh, as of the pantaloon.
A superfluous list is usually left outside the seam, which,
if of skin, is slitted into long tassels, or if of cloth, the wide
border remains entire, to dangle and flap upon the exterior
of the legs. A strip of strouding (that is, coarse broad-cloth)
about a foot in width and a yard or more long, constitutes
the most usual flap; which being passed betwixt the
legs, the ends are secured under the belt around the waist,
whence the leggins are suspended. As the flap is sometimes
near two yards long, a surplusage of half a yard or
more at each end is sometimes left dangling down before
and behind.</p>

<p>The Indians use no head-dress, but support the bleakest
rains and hottest suns of those bare plains with naked
heads. Nevertheless, their coarse black hair seems 'fertilized'
by exposure; for they rarely become gray till an
exceeding old age; and I do not recollect to have ever seen
a bald Indian. Their eyesight also, they retain in extraordinary
vigor, notwithstanding the want of protection
even of the eye-lashes and brows (which are plucked out),
and in spite of the constant use of apparently deleterious
paints around the edges {290} of the lids. Though using
no regular head-dress, they sometimes wear, as a temporary
ornament, a fantastic cap of skins; and it is not unusual
to see a brave with the entire shaggy frontlet of a buffalo, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg329"></a>[p329]</span>
horns and all, set upon his head—which, with his painted
face, imparts a diabolical ferocity to his aspect.</p>

<p>The Indians of the Plains, almost without exception,
wear long hair, which dangles in clotted tresses over the
shoulders—besmeared with gum, grease and paints, and
ornamented with feathers and trinkets. But most of those
intermediate tribes nearer our border, trim their hair in a
peculiar manner.</p>

<p>Vermillion seems almost indispensable to the Indian's
toilet; but in default of this they paint with colored earths.
When going to war, they bedaub their bodies with something
black—mud, charcoal or gunpowder, which gives
them a frightful appearance. But 'ornamental' painting
is much more gay and fanciful. The face, and sometimes
arms and breast are oddly striped and chequered, interspersed
with shades of yellow and white clay, as well as
occasional black, though the latter is chiefly appropriated
to war. Especial pains are taken to tip the eyelids most
gaily with vermillion.</p>

<p>Besides painting, most of the tribes tattoo—some sparingly,
while others make their faces, breasts, and particularly
their arms, perfectly piebald. This seems practised
to some extent by all the savages from the Atlantic {291}
to the Pacific. Figures are pierced in the skin with any
sharp pointed instrument—often the keen prickles of
the cactus—and pulverized charcoal or gunpowder, or
sometimes the coloring juice of a plant, is rubbed into
the fresh punctures, which leaves a lasting stain.</p>

<p>The most usual female dress is of the style worn by the
Comanche squaws, which is described in speaking of that
nation. With respect to dress and other ornaments, however,
the order of the civilized world is reversed among
the Indians. The 'fair sex' paint less than the men—use
fewer ornaments generally, and particularly, wear <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg330"></a>[p330]</span>
no pendants in the ears. While a savage beauty pays
but little attention to her person, a 'brave' will spend as
much time at his toilet as a French belle, in the adjustment
of his ornaments—his paint, trinkets, beads and
other gewgaws. A mirror is his idol: no warrior is
equipped without this indispensable toilet companion,
which he very frequently consults. He usually takes it
from its original case, and sets it in a large fancifully carved
frame of wood, which is always carried about him. He is
also rarely without his tweezers, whether of a fold of tin, of
hardened wood, or of spirally twisted wire, with which
he carefully eradicates, not only his beard, eye-lashes and
brows, but every villous particle from his body, as fast
as it appears; for everything of the kind is considered
as extremely unbecoming a warrior. It is on this account
that Indians {292} have frequently been represented as
naturally beardless.</p>

<p>All Indians are passionately fond of beads, trinkets
and gewgaws of every kind. The men often cut up the
rim of the ears in a frightful manner to admit their pendants
of beads, plate, shells, etc.; and even strips of lead
are sometimes twined around the separated rim, by the
weight of which the detached portion of the ear is frequently
swagged down some inches. It is not unusual to see near
half a pound even of beads and 'jewelry' swung to each
ear; and among some tribes, also a large quantity to the
nose. The hair is likewise garnished with the same, and
the neck with strings of beads, bear's claws, and the like;
while the arms are profusely ornamented with bracelets
of wire or plated metal. The 'braves' are those who
commonly deck themselves with the most gaudy trappings,
and would usually be taken by a stranger for the chiefs of
the band, who, on the other hand, are often apparelled
in the most ordinary manner. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg331"></a>[p331]</span></p>

<p>The squaws are, in every sense of the word the slaves of
the men. They are called upon to perform every toilsome
service—to carry wood and make fires—to skin and dress
the meat and prepare the food—to herd, drive up, saddle
and unsaddle their lords' horses—to pitch and strike the
lodges—to pack up the baggage, and often indeed to
carry heavy loads during travel—in short, everything
else pretty much but fight and hunt, which the {293} Indian
boasts of, as being his peculiar, if not his sole vocations.</p>

<p>What little of manufacturing is done among the Indians
is also the work of the women. They prepare the different
articles of apparel. In embroidering moccasins and their
leathern petticoats, etc., their greatest skill, particularly
among the northern tribes, is exhibited. But the most
extensive article of their manufacture is the <i>buffalo rug</i>,
which they not only prepare for their own use, but which constitutes
the largest item of their traffic with the Indian traders.
These are dressed and cured exclusively by the squaws.</p>

<p>To dress a buffalo rug, the first step is to 'flesh' the skin,
or neatly scrape from the inner surface every carneous
particle. This is generally done with an instrument of
bone, cut something in the shape of a small adz, with a
serrate edge. For this operation the skin is sometimes
suspended in a frame upon the branch of a tree, or a fork
of the lodge—though more commonly, perhaps, stretched
with pegs upon the smooth ground, with the flesh-side up.
After it dries, the spongy surface of the skin is neatly curried
off with another adz-shaped bone or handle of wood,
with a flat bit of iron transversely set for the blade, which
is edged after the manner of a currier's instrument. The
surface is then besmeared with brains (which the Canadians
call <dfn>mettre à la cervelle</dfn>), and rolled up with the flesh-side
in, in which condition it is left for two or three days. The
brains of the same {294} animals are generally used; those <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg332"></a>[p332]</span>
of a buffalo being more than sufficient to dress his own
hide. The pores of the skin being fully penetrated by
the brains, it is again wetted, and softened by continual
working and rubbing till it dries. To facilitate this last
operation, it is sometimes stretched in a frame and suspended
before a fire, when the inner surface is scraped
with the serrated adz before mentioned, and finished off
by assiduous rubbing with a pumice-stone, if that article
can be had; if not, by passing the skin by small sections
rapidly back and forth over a slack cord.</p>

<p>Buffalo rugs are often observed with a seam in the middle.
This is caused by cutting them in two, partly for
convenience in dressing them, and partly to take out the
hollow occasioned by the hump, particularly of the bulls.
The hump of the cow being less, their skins generally bear
dressing without being cut. The hide is frequently split
in two, however, in skinning the animal, the Indians preferring
to commence on the back.</p>

<p>The buffalo skin is often dressed without the wool. To
this end the hide is soaked in water till the hair is loosened,
when it is 'curried' and 'brained,' and softened as above.
Of these dressed buffalo skins (known among Mexicans
as <dfn>anta blanca</dfn>) is made a considerable portion of the Indian
clothing for both sexes—even the petticoats of the females;
though these prefer buckskin when they can procure it.</p>

<p>The chief aliment of the Prairie Indians is {295} flesh,
though in default of this they often sustain themselves
for weeks together upon roots, herbs and fruits. The buffalo
are the common herds of these savages, affording them
'food, raiment and shelter.' It seems there were anciently
occasional cannibal tribes<a name="FNanchor_207_208" id="FNanchor_207_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_208" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> in those regions, but not a <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg333"></a>[p333]</span>
vestige of cannibalism, as I believe, now remains; except
such an inhuman appetite may be ascribed to some of
the more savage warriors, who, as I have heard, in the
delirium of exultant victory, have been known to devour
the hearts of their bravest victims, at once to satiate their
blood-thirsty propensities, and to appropriate to themselves,
as they fancy, the valor of the slain enemy.</p>

<p>However, they make food of nearly every animal of their
country, and often of insects and even the filthiest vermin.
By some tribes, grasshoppers, locusts and the like are
collected and dried for future use. Among nearly all the
northern tribes, the flesh of the dog<a name="FNanchor_208_209" id="FNanchor_208_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_209" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> is considered as the
greatest delicacy; so much so, indeed, that when a favorite
visitor is expected to dine, they are sure to have served
up for him the choicest pieces from some one of the many
fat whelps which pertain to every lodge. In this way
travellers have often been {296} constrained to eat Indian
dog-meat, and which, prejudice apart, is by no means an
unsavory viand; but the flesh of the wolf, and even the
American dog, is generally said to be ill-flavored and sometimes
insupportable. The polecat is also a favorite food
among the Indians; and though the celebrated Irving,
during a "Tour on the Prairies," seems to claim a deal
of credit for having "plumped into the river" a dressed
polecat, whereby he prevented an Osage from "disgracing"
their fire by the cooking of it, yet all travellers who have
tasted the flesh of this animal have pronounced it fine, and
of exquisite relish.<a name="FNanchor_209_210" id="FNanchor_209_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_210" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> "The flesh of the skunk," observes
Dr. James, in his account of Maj. Long's Expedition, "we <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg334"></a>[p334]</span>
sometimes had dressed for dinner, and found it remarkably
rich and delicate food."</p>

<p>These wild tribes are without other kitchen utensils than
an occasional kettle. They sometimes broil their meats,
but often eat them raw. A savage will feast upon the
warm carcass of the buffalo; selecting bits of the tenderloin,
liver, etc., and it is not uncommon to see him use the gall
as sauce! Feasting is one of their favorite enjoyments;
though their ability to endure hunger almost exceeds belief.
They will fast a week and yet retain their strength and
vigor: but then when they do procure food again, it seems
as if they never would be satiated.</p>

<p>The Indians of the Prairies have become acquainted
with the medical virtues of many of their indigenous plants,
which are often {297} used in connection with the vapor
sweat, and cold bath: wherefore we may consider them as
the primitive Thomsonians.<a name="FNanchor_210_211" id="FNanchor_210_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_211" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> After a profuse sweating,
assisted by decoctions of sudorific herbs, in a tight lodge
filled with vapor by pouring water over heated stones, and
while still dripping, they will leap into a pool of cold water,
and afterwards wrap themselves in a buffalo rug. This
course has proved successful in some diseases, and extraordinary
cures have thus been performed: but in other
cases, and especially in the small-pox, it has been attended
with horrible fatality. They frequently let blood for disease,
which is oftenest performed with the keen edge of a
flint: and though they sometimes open a vein, they more
commonly make their incisions indiscriminately. They
have great faith in their 'medicine men,' who pretend to
cure the sick with conjurations and charms; and the Comanches
and many others often keep up an irksome, monotonous
singing over the diseased person, to frighten away <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg335"></a>[p335]</span>
the evil spirit which is supposed to torment him: all of
which, from its effect upon the imagination, often tends,
no doubt, to hasten recovery.</p>

<p>These Indians keep no domestic animals, except horses,
mules, and dogs. With the latter every lodge is abundantly
supplied; yet, as has already been shown, they are more
useful appendages than the annoying packs which so often
infest the country cabins, and frequently the villages, in
the United States. {298} Horses, however, constitute the
chief wealth of the prairie Indian. These are the incentives
to most of their predatory excursions. The tribes of the
north in particular, as well as the white trappers, frequently
maintain their horses, during winter, upon the tender
bark of the sweet cottonwood, the <i>populus angulata</i> of the
Mississippi valley.</p>

<p>The western savages know nothing of the value of money.
The wampum bead, it is true, among a few tribes, somewhat
resembles a currency: for, being generally esteemed,
it acquires a value in proportion to size, and sometimes
passes from hand to hand, in exchange for necessaries.
The legitimate wampum is only of shells, and was of aboriginal
manufacture; being small long tubes with an ovate
surface, or sometimes simply cylindrical; and handsomely
polished: but imitations of glass or porcelain seem now
the most common. The color is generally white, though
sometimes blue or striped.</p>

<p>These Indians have no knowledge of the divisions of
time, except by palpable distinctions; as days, moons and
years; which last they commonly represent as so many
springs, or falls of the leaves, or as often by winters, that
is, frosts or snows. Distances are represented by days'
journey, which are oftener designated by camps or 'sleeps.'
When a day's journey is spoken of in general terms, it is
meant that of a band in regular travel, which rarely exceeds
twenty miles.</p>

<p>The tribes inhabiting near the borders of the frontier
Indians differ from those that range the far-western prairies
in several traits of general character. The former have
their fixed villages, and, for the most part, combine the
pursuits of agriculture and the chase. They form, indeed,
a sort of intermediate class between the frontier and the
wild tribes, resembling the one or the other in all important
particulars. I will merely notice in this place a few of the
characteristics by which the more conspicuous of these
tribes are distinguished.</p>

<p>Their village wigwams differ from the lodges of the
wilder tribes, in their being {300} much more substantial,
and usually covered with grass and earth instead of skins.
The Indians commonly remain in their villages during
the inclement portion of the winter; yet most of them spend
the early spring upon the Prairies in buffalo-hunting;
as well as such portions of the summer and autumn as are
not occupied in the cultivation and gathering of their crops,
which they secure in <i>caches</i> till their return.</p>

<p>In dress they differ but little from the wilder tribes,
except that, having more communication with the whites,
they make greater use of our fabrics—blankets, coarse
cloths, calicoes and the like. Their most striking peculiarity
consists in the cut of their hair. Most of them, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg337"></a>[p337]</span>
instead, like the Indians of the Plains, of wearing the hair
long, trim and arrange it in the most fantastic style. In
the care bestowed upon this part of their toilet, they cannot
be excelled by the most <i>soigneux</i> of civilized dandies.
They shave a large portion of the head, but leave a fanciful
lock upon the crown as a scalp-crest (an indispensable
trophy for the enemy), which is in general gorgeously
bedecked with painted feathers and gewgaws.</p>

<p>The <i>Pawnees</i>, who now have their principal village
on the Loup Fork of the Platte river, are perhaps the most
famous of these tribes. Small bands of their war-parties
roam on foot through every portion of the Prairies, often
to the Mexican frontier, though they generally contrive
to return well mounted. {301} When upon these expeditions,
they may properly enough be considered the Ishmaelites
of the Prairies—their hands are against every
man, and every man's hand is against them. They will
skulk about in the vicinity of a prize of mules or horses
for several days unsuspected, till a favorable opportunity
offers to pounce upon them.</p>

<p>This nation is divided into four principal bands, the
Grand Pawnees (or <i>Grand Pans</i>, as called by the Canadians),
the Republics, the Mahas or Loups, and the Tapage or
Noisy Pawnees. Their relatives, the Rickaras, are now
considered a distinct tribe.<a name="FNanchor_211_212" id="FNanchor_211_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_212" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Osages</i> are at present the most important western
branch of the Dahcotah stock, after the Sioux. There
are two bands of them, the Big and Little Osages.<a name="FNanchor_212_213" id="FNanchor_212_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_213" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
Though the Pawnees stand most prominent as prairie
marauders, these are unsurpassed in simple rogueries.
Expertness at stealing appears indeed to constitute a part <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg338"></a>[p338]</span>
of their faith, and an all-important branch of education,
in which degrees are conferred in true 'academic order;'
for I have been assured, that, in their councils, the claims
of the candidates to the honors of rogueship are duly considered,
and to the most proficient is awarded an honorary
badge—the right to wear a fancy feather stuck athwart
his scalp-crest.</p>

<p>The habitudes of the Osages do not appear to have
undergone any material change, notwithstanding the exertions
of the government and the missionaries to civilize
and to christianize {302} them. Some of their matrimonial
customs are very curious and rather peculiar. The eldest
daughter seems not only 'heiress apparent,' but, when
married, becomes absolute owner of the entire property
and household of her parents—family and all. While
single, however, she has no authority, but is herself held
as a piece of merchantable property, estimated somewhat
as in civilized life, in proportion to her 'charms,' and to
the value of her 'hereditaments.' She is therefore kept
under the strictest watch by her parents, that she may not
diminish her worth by any improper conduct.</p>

<p>When some warrior 'beau' has taken a fancy to the
heiress and wishes to possess her and her estate of sisters,
dogs, rugs and household, he takes his finest horses, (and
if she be a 'belle' he need not attempt it unless he have
some of the noblest), and tying them at her lodge door
departs without saying a word; leaving them, like a slow-match,
silently to effect his purpose. After the 'pretender'
has disappeared, the matron of the premises and her lord
inspect the valuables, the 'demure damsel' barely venturing
a sly peep through some crevice of the wigwam. If the
offer be found unworthy, the horses are sent back to the
owner as silently as they came, or maybe with some apology,
provided he be a warrior whom they are afraid of offending. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg339"></a>[p339]</span>
But if accepted, the father takes instead some of his own
horses and ties them at the door of the proposer, as a token
of admission. If the {303} parties be without horses, some
other valuables are employed in lieu. After this the marriage
is solemnized with a joyous fête, and their primitive
ceremonies.</p>

<p>But now the son-in-law is fully indemnified for his heavy
'disbursement' in the <i>purchase</i> of his bride; for he at once
becomes possessor of the entire wealth of his father-in-law—master
of the family-lodge and all the household: if
there be a dozen younger daughters, they are all <i>de droit</i>—his
wives or slaves as we may choose to consider them:
in fact, the 'heiress' herself seems in the same predicament,
and the wife among them all who may have the tact
to gain the husband's affections, generally becomes mistress
of the 'harem.' From the refuse of this estate of 'fair
ones' the indigent warriors and inferior Indians who are
not able to purchase an 'heiress' are apt to supply themselves
with wives upon a cheaper scale.<a name="FNanchor_213_214" id="FNanchor_213_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_214" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>The Osages bury their dead according to the usual
Indian mode; and, though it seems always to have been
the custom among most {304} savage nations, to keep up
a chorus of hideous cries and yells for a long while after
the death of a relative, yet the Osages are by far the most
accomplished mourners of them all. Being once encamped
near a party of them, I was awakened at the dawn of day <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg340"></a>[p340]</span>
by the most doleful, piteous, heart-rending howls and
lamentations. The apparently distressed mourners would
cry with a protracted expiration till completely out of breath.
For some instants he seemed to be in the very last agonies:
then he would recover breath with a smothered, gurgling
inspiration: and thus he continued for several minutes,
giving vent to every variety of hideous and terrific sounds.
Looking around, I perceived the weeper standing with
his face towards the faint gleam which flitted from the
still obscured sun. This was perhaps his idol; else he
was standing thus because his deceased relation lay in
that direction. A full 'choir' of these mourners (which
is always joined by the howls and yelps of their myriads
of dogs), imparts the most frightful horror to a wilderness
camp.</p>

<p>It is considered among these as well as other 'crying'
tribes, quite a merit to be a graceful weeper: it becomes
even a profitable vocation to those whose eyes and lungs
are most capacious of such things. If you tell an Osage
that you have lost a kinsman or friend for whom you wish
him to mourn, he will undertake the service for a trifling
reward—and acquit himself with more 'credit'—more
to the spirit than the best tragic {305} actor. He will
mimic every exterior indication of grief and the most heart-felt
wailing, till the tears trickle in torrents down his cheeks.<a name="FNanchor_214_215" id="FNanchor_214_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_215" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>The Osages seem generally to worship a good and evil
spirit, and to believe in the most usual Indian paradise.
No people can have more implicit faith in witchcraft and
all kinds of sorcery and superstitions—such as holding
converse with deceased friends or relations—appointing
a time to die, etc.: and instances are related of their fancying <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg341"></a>[p341]</span>
themselves thus called to the world of spirits, which
would so powerfully affect the imagination as to cause them
to pine away, and sometimes die even to the appointed day.</p>

<p>Owing partially, no doubt, to the burdensome life they
lead, the squaws of all the tribes are, for the most part,
much more inclined to corpulency than the men. They
are generally chubby and ill-favored, while the males are
usually tall, erect, well-turned and active. For their
proverbial straightness, however, the Osages are perhaps
more famous than any of the other prairie Indians.</p>

<p>The <i>Wacoes</i>, <i>Witchitas</i> and their kindred tribes on Red
River, are, for the most part, a very indigent race. They
are chiefly remarkable for their profuse tatooing, whereby
they have sometimes acquired the title of 'Pawnee Picts:'
the females particularly make a perfect calico of the whole
under-jaw, breast and arms, and the mammæ are fancifully
ornamented with rings and rays. The tattoo, in fact,
seems to constitute the chief female ornament {306} of
these tribes; for their only gown consists of about a yard
and a half of strouding, or else a small dressed skin, suspended
from the waist, and constituting a sort of primitive
petticoat. The upper portion of the body remains uncovered,
except by a blanket or small skin, thrown loosely
over the shoulders. The men are often without any other
vesture than the flap, and sometimes a buffalo rug or blanket.</p>

<p>As the remaining tribes of this intermediate class present
few or no distinctive characteristics, we will pass at once
to the consideration of the <i>wild tribes</i> proper<a name="FNanchor_215_216" id="FNanchor_215_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_216" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> of the Great <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg342"></a>[p342]</span>
Western Prairies. These neither cultivate the soil nor
live in fixed villages, but lead a roving life in pursuit of
plunder and game, and without ever submitting themselves
to that repose—to those fixed habits, which must always
precede any progress in civilization. But as the <i>Comanches</i>
are the only tribe of these 'wandering Arabs' of the Plains
which {307} present any distinguishing features of interest—any
prominent points of national character—the remarks
that follow will be devoted almost exclusively to
them.</p>

<p>The relationship of the Comanches to the Snakes or
Shoshonies, shows them to have descended from the north:
in fact, it is but half a century since their range was from
the Arkansas river northward; but at present this stream
is their <i>ultima Thule</i>. Yet they even now acknowledge
no boundaries, but call themselves the lords of the entire
Prairies—all others are but 'tenants at will.' They
lead a wandering sort of life, betaking themselves whithersoever
the seasons or the habits of the buffalo, their chief
object of pursuit, may lead them. Although during summer
they are not unfrequently found as far north as the
Arkansas river, their winters they usually pass about the
head branches of the Brazos and Colorado rivers of Texas.</p>

<p>In their domestic habits, these Indians, for the most
part, resemble the other wild tribes; yet in some respects
they differ materially. One of the most interesting traits
of difference is to be found in their distaste for ardent <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg343"></a>[p343]</span>
spirits: but few of them can be induced to taste a drop of
intoxicating liquors; thus forming an exception, I believe,
to the entire race of the 'red man,' who appears to have a
constitutional appetite for strong drinks. The frontier
as well as the prairie tribes—the Mexican as well as the
Mountain Indians—all are equally slaves to their use.</p>

<p>{308} The Comanches are divided into numerous petty
bands, each under the control of its own particular chief.
When a chief becomes old and care-worn, he exercises
but the 'civil authority' of his clan; while his son, if deemed
worthy, otherwise some distinguished brave, assumes,
by 'common consent,' the functions of war-chief. As is
the case with all barbarous tribes, their chiefs assume
every judicial and executive authority. Complaints are
made to them and sentence summarily pronounced, and
often as summarily executed. For most offences, the chief,
if he considers his authority sufficiently well established,
freely uses the rod upon his subjects. He rarely attempts
this, however, upon noted warriors or 'braves,' whose
influence and resentment he may have reason to fear. The
punishment of murder among these, as among most of
the savage nations, devolves upon the bereaved relatives,
who are free to pursue and punish the perpetrators according
to their own liking, which is seldom short of death.
But the offended party, if disposed to compromise, has
also the privilege of accepting a commutation and releasing
the murderer.</p>

<p>The husband seems to have complete power over the
destinies of his wife and children. For adultery, his punishment
is most usually to cut off the nose or ears,<a name="FNanchor_216_217" id="FNanchor_216_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_217" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> or {309}
both; and he may even take the life of his unfaithful wife <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg344"></a>[p344]</span>
with impunity. The squaw who has been mutilated for
such a cause, is <i>ipso facto</i> divorced, and, it is said, for ever
precluded from marrying again. The consequence is,
that she becomes a confirmed harlot in the tribe. Owing
in part, no doubt, to such severity in their customs, the
Comanche squaws have ever been noted for their chastity.
This may result also, in some degree, from the circumstance,
that the Comanche husbands, fathers and brothers, seldom
or never subject their wives, daughters and sisters, to that
debasing traffic practised among so many of the northern
nations.</p>

<p>Like other wild tribes, the Comanches tolerate polygamy,
the chiefs and braves sometimes taking as many as eight
or ten wives at a time. Three is considered the usual
number, however, for 'subjects' or common warriors,
and nine for the chiefs. Their marriage ceremonies vary
in different bands; but the following has been represented
as the most usual. Unlike most other tribes, the consent
of the maiden has to be obtained. This done, the lover,
from apparent delicacy, goes not to the father of his intended,
but, in accordance with a custom which prevails
among some other tribes, communicates his desire to an
uncle or other aged relative, who enters into the marriage
contract. The parties, however, are not yet fully betrothed;
but, as a test of the submission of the bride to the service
of her proposed lord, the latter ties his riding-horse {310}
at her lodge door. If she turn him loose, she has resolved
finally to reject him; but if she lead him to the <i>caballada</i>,
it is an unequivocal agreement to take the charge of his
horses and other property; and the marriage is soon concluded.
The 'uncle' now communicates the engagement
to the chief, who causes the 'bans' to be published, that
no other wooer may interfere. As the horse is with them
the type of every important interest, the bridegroom next <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg345"></a>[p345]</span>
proceeds to kill the least valuable one he is possessed of;
and, taking out the heart, hangs it at the door of his betrothed,
who takes and roasts it, and then dividing it into
two parts, each eats a half, which perfects the bond of
wedlock. The heart of the buffalo or other animal may
perhaps be substituted, if the bridegroom has not a superabundance
of horses. Should the circumstances of the
parties admit of it, the marriage is usually celebrated with
feasting and dances; though, in general, the Comanches
are less fond of dancing than most other Indians.</p>

<p>The Comanche dress consists of the usual leggins, moccasins,
flap and blanket or robe. Many wear in addition
a kind of leathern jerkin, or tight jacket closed before.
Their moccasins differ from those of other tribes, by having
a lengthy tassel of leathern fringes attached to the heels,
which trail the ground as they walk. Instead of this fringe,
the tassels sometimes consists of the tail of a polecat or
some other animal. When he can procure {311} it, the
young warrior is wont to wear a mantle and leggins of
strouding. Both of these articles, according to the 'latest
fashions,' should be one-half red, the other blue. The
bi-colored mantle, as well as the blanket or buffalo rug,
is carelessly thrown over the shoulders, and must be long
enough to drag the ground; for they seem to have an instinct
for the 'regal grandeur of a sweeping gown.'</p>

<p>Though all the far-western Indians wear their hair long,
the Comanche seems to take most pride in the voluminousness
of his 'tresses,' and the length of his <i>queue</i>, which is
sometimes eked out with buffalo or other hair, till its tip
reaches the ground, and is bedaubed with gum, grease and
paint, and decorated with beads and other gewgaws. We
are not to think that foppery and coxcombry are generated
exclusively in civilized life. I am sure I never saw a vainer
creature than a Comanche brave in full costume, of dress, <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg346"></a>[p346]</span>
trinkets and paint. He steps as if he disdained the very
ground upon which he walks.</p>

<p>The dress of the Comanche squaw is usually a kind of
loose gown or tunic of leather, or cotton if it can be procured,
which hangs from the shoulders and is bound around
the waist with a girdle; thus presenting a resemblance in
its appearance to our ordinary female costume. They
wear moccasins, to which short leggins are attached, and
which constitute a sort of leathern hose. They are not
permitted to wear long hair: that 'manly' prerogative
would be degraded by such an {312} association. It is
therefore kept docked so as scarcely to reach the shoulders.</p>

<p>A style of dress similar to that of the Comanche females,
is worn by those of most of the erratic tribes. The squaws
of the north usually embroider their leathern frocks in a
fanciful manner with colored porcupine quills and beads,
and bedeck the borders with rattling shells, tags, hawk-bells,
and the like. Such as have the fortune to marry
Canadian or American trappers, are those who usually
dress most gaily.</p>

<p>The prairie Indians generally are an equestrian race;
yet in horsemanship the Comanches stand decidedly preeminent;
and can only be equalled by the Northern Mexicans,
and perhaps the Arabs. Like the latter, they dote
upon their steeds: one had as well undertake to purchase
a Comanche's child as his favorite riding-horse. They
have a peculiar mark for their animals: every one which has
pertained to them may always be recognized by a slit in
the tip of each ear; a practice apparently universal among
all their tribe.</p>

<p>In their warlike expeditions they avail themselves of their
equestrian skill with wonderful success. As they always
fight on horseback, they depend chiefly upon the charge,
at which they use their arrows and javelins with wonderful <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg347"></a>[p347]</span>
efficacy.<a name="FNanchor_217_218" id="FNanchor_217_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_218" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> On such occasions a Comanche will often throw
himself upon {313} the opposite side of his charger, so as
to be protected from the darts of the enemy; and, while
clinging there, he will discharge his arrows with extraordinary
dexterity from underneath his horse's neck. Different
from the 'prowling' tribes, they seldom attack at night,
or in timbered or rough regions; for they would then be
unable to manœuvre their coursers to advantage.</p>

<p>Although not meriting the title of brave Indians, they
are held by the Mexicans as the most valiant of their border:
but when they come in contact with Americans or any of
our frontier tribes, they generally appear timid and cowardly.
Their predatory forays are therefore directed mostly
westward. They make continual inroads upon the whole
eastern frontier of Mexico, from Chihuahua to the coast;
driving off immense numbers of horses and mules, and
killing the citizens they may encounter, or making them
prisoners—particularly the females and boys. Of the
latter they make slaves, to perform such menial service
as usually pertains to the squaws, particularly the herding
of the stock. It is perhaps this alleviation of their labor by
slaves, that has contributed to elevate the Comanche women
above those of many of the northern tribes. Of their
female captives they often make wives; a fate which has
befallen some of those taken from Texas.</p>

<p>Strange as it may appear, their captives frequently become
attached to their masters and to the savage life, and
with difficulty are {314} induced to leave them after a few
years' captivity. In fact, these prisoners, it is said, in time
often turn out to be the most formidable savages. Combining
the subtlety of the Mexican with the barbarity of
the Indian, they sometimes pilot into their native frontier <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg348"></a>[p348]</span>
and instigate horrid outrages. The department of Chihuahua
has been the greatest sufferer from their inroads.</p>

<p>But, though at continual war with the south of the republic,
for many years the Comanches have cultivated
peace with the New Mexicans—not only because the
poverty of the country offers fewer inducements for their
inroads, but because it is desirable, as with the interior
Mexican tribes, to retain some friendly point with which
to keep an amicable intercourse and traffic. Parties of
them have therefore sometimes entered the settlements
of New Mexico for trading purposes; while every season
numerous bands of New Mexicans, known as <i>Comancheros</i>,
supplied with arms, ammunitions, trinkets, provisions
and other necessaries, launch upon the Prairies to barter
for mules, and the different fruits of their ravages upon
the south.</p>

<p>This powerful nation, combined with the petty southern
tribes, has also waged an almost unceasing warfare upon
Texas, ever since her independence. War-parties have
frequently penetrated to the very heart of the settlements,
perpetrating murderous outrages, and bearing away into
captivity numerous women and children. They have
entered {315} the city of Austin, then the seat of government,
in open day; and, at other times, have been known
to descend to the very seacoast, committing many frightful
depredations. "On the 8th of August, 1840," writes a
friend who resided at Linnville, on Matagorda Bay, "several
hundred Comanches came down from the mountains,
and charged upon us without the least notice. They
burned and made a perfect destruction of the village and
everything pertaining to it."<a name="FNanchor_218_219" id="FNanchor_218_219"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_218_219" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg349"></a>[p349]</span></p>

<p> Besides continual hostilities with Mexico and Texas, the
Comanches are at war with most of the Indians of the
Mexican interior, as also with the tribes of the more northern
prairies—and particularly the Arrapahoes and Chayennes,
with whom they have many bloody rencounters.<a name="FNanchor_219_220" id="FNanchor_219_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_220" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> But
they generally remain on friendly terms with the petty
tribes of the south, whom, indeed, they seem to hold as their
vassals.</p>

<p>As these Indians always go to war on horseback, several
days are often spent previous to a campaign in equestrian
exercises and ceremonies, which seem partly to supply the
place of the war-dance of other tribes; though they sometimes
join in preparatory dances also. It is not an unusual
custom, when a campaign is in agitation, for a band of about
twenty Comanche maidens to chant, for three nights in
succession, the victories of their ancestors, the valor of their
brothers and cotemporaries, and the individual prowess
of all such young warriors as they consider should engage in
{316} the contemplated enterprise: and all those designated
by the serenading band are held as drafted for the <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg350"></a>[p350]</span>
campaign. Fired by the encomiums and excitations of the
'fair <i>cantatrices</i>,' they fly at once to the standard of their
favorite chief: and the ceremony is concluded by a war-dance.</p>

<p>Upon their return from a successful expedition, the
'war-worn corps' halts on some elevation at a distance
from the village, and a herald is sent forward to announce
their arrival. Thereupon, one of their most respectable
and aged matrons issues forth to receive them, carrying
with her a very long-handled lance kept for the purpose.
On the top of this the victorious Indians fasten all the
scalps they may have taken, so arranged that each shall
be conspicuous. The matron squaw then approaches the
wigwams, holding her scalp-garnished lance high in the
air, and chanting some favorite war-legend. She is soon
joined by other squaws and Indian lasses, who dance
around as the procession moves through the entire circuit
of the village. If the victory has been brilliant, the dancing
and feasting are apt to be kept up for several days, all
parties joining in the general jubilee.</p>

<p>If the conquerors bring any prisoners with them, these
have to encounter the scourgings and insults of the squaws
and children. Each seems entitled to a blow, a kick, a
pinch, a bite, or whatever simple punishment they may
choose to inflict upon the unfortunate captives. This
done, they are delivered {317} over to the captors as slaves,
and put to the service and drudgery of the camp.</p>

<p>After their first entrance it seems rare for them to treat
their captives with much cruelty: though an instance was
related to me by some Mexican prisoners, of a very barbarous
massacre which they witnessed during their captivity.
Two white men, supposed to be Texans, were
tied to a stake, and a number of their marksmen, retiring
to a distance and using the naked bodies of their victims <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg351"></a>[p351]</span>
as targets, began wantonly to fire at them, and continued
their horrid sport, until some fatal balls put an end to their
sufferings! The capture of these had probably been attended
with some aggravating circumstances, which induced
the savages to resort to this cruel method of satiating
their revenge.</p>

<p>If a campaign has been unsuccessful, the warriors separate
upon their return, and drop into the village one by
one. Nothing is now heard for several days, but the wailings
and howlings of the bereft relatives and friends. They
will also scarify their arms and legs, and subject themselves
to other carnal mortifications of the most powerful
character. On these occasions their previous captives,
and particularly such as may belong to the nation of their
victorious enemy, are sure to be roughly treated, and sometimes
massacred by the enraged relatives of the slain.</p>

<p>When a Comanche dies, a similar course of mourning
is practised; and he is usually wrapped in his best blankets
or robes, and interred {318} with most of his 'jewelry' and
other articles of esteem; accompanying which, it is said,
an awl and some moccasin leather is generally added, as
a provision, it would appear, for his use during his long
journey to the 'happy hunting ground' beyond the grave.
They also kill the favorite horses of the deceased, which
are often buried by his side, doubtless with the same object.</p>

<p>The religious notions of the Comanches resemble, in
most particulars, those of the other prairie tribes; yet they
appear to have an occasional peculiarity. Some say the
dry buffalo head or cranium is their idol. True it is that
they show it great reverence, and use it in many of their
mystic ceremonies. The Pawnees also hold these buffalo
heads, with which the plains are strewed, in great reverence;
and usually for many leagues around, these skulls are set
up facing towards their villages, in the belief that the herds <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg352"></a>[p352]</span>
of buffalo will thus be conducted by them into their neighborhood.<a name="FNanchor_220_221" id="FNanchor_220_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_221" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
Of the Comanches the sun is no doubt the
principal deity. When preparing for a campaign, it is
said they do not fail to place their arms betimes every
morning on the east side of their lodges, that they may
receive the blessing of the fountain of light at his first appearance.
This indeed seems the usual time for offering
their devotions to the sun, of many tribes of the American
aborigines.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_205_206" id="Footnote_205_206"></a><a href="#FNanchor_205_206"><span class="label">[205]</span></a> This seems to have been of ancient and general use among the savages of
North America. "I must speak here of the <i>Calumet</i>," remarks Father Marquette,
"the most mysterious thing in the world. The sceptres of our kings are not so
much respected; for the savages have such a deference for this pipe, that one may
call it <i>the god of peace and war, and the arbiter of life and death</i>. One, with this
calumet, may venture amongst his enemies, and in the hottest engagement they
lay down their arms before this sacred pipe." The deference is perhaps not so
great at the present day, though the 'pipe of peace' is still very much respected.
Even the ashes from the calumet seem to be held sacred; for, usually after smoking,
the pipe is emptied in some corner of the lodge specially allotted for the purpose.
But as they have generally learned that smoking is not practised by the whites
on these occasions, it is now not commonly held important for us to smoke with
them; but presents are expected instead. Anciently, however, they were more
strict; for, in another place, the same author (in 1673) relates:—"As soon as we
sat down, they presented us, according to custom, their <i>calumet</i>, which one must
needs accept, for else he should be lookt upon as an enemy, or a meer brute; however,
it is not necessary to smoak, and provided one puts it to his mouth,
it is enough."—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span>

among the Kansas, Omahas and other kindred tribes; indeed it appears to have
prevailed from the earliest ages among all the Dahcotah family as well as many
Algonquins and most other tribes about the great Lakes. Mons. La Salle, in his
trip from these to the Mississippi in 1673, remarks of the savages of those regions:
"They marry several Wives, and commonly all Sisters, if they can, thinking they
agree better in their Family." Hennepin, Charlevoix and others speak of the
same custom. Murray also mentions something of the kind among the Pawnees.
Forbes alludes to the same in California. But I am uninformed, whether, in
these several instances, the husband's right was only <i>de facto</i>, or <i>de jure</i> as among
the Osages, to all the younger sisters.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span></p></div>

Commissioner of Indian Affairs, for 1844 is as follows: Pawnees, 12,500 souls
(though some experienced traders rate them at only about 5,000); Rickaras, 1,200;
Chippewas, Potawatomies and Ottawas of the North, 2,298; Sacs and Foxes,
2,762; Winnebagoes, 2,183; Iowas, 470; Poncas, 777; Omahas, 1,301; Otoes and
Missouries, 931; Kansas, 1,700; Osages, 4,102;—besides of Caddoes and Inyes
about 500; Wacoes, Witchitas, Towockanoes, Towyashes and Keechyes, 1,000;
who maintain themselves chiefly in Northern Texas. The wild tribes proper of
the Prairies, are, the Comanches, consisting of about 10,000 souls; Kiawas, 2,000;
Apaches, 100; Arrapahoes, 2,000; Chayennes, 2,000; besides many others to the
north and westward, who rarely descend within the regions to the notice of which
these pages are confined. As these tribes would doubtless average at least three-fifths
females, they could hardly turn out one-fifth of their numbers in warriors,
though this is the usual rule of estimating them by men of Indian experience.—<span class="smcap">Gregg.</span></p></div>

settlement, and about 1757 destroying the mission of San Saba. In 1785 the
troops were obliged to retire into the Alamo at San Antonio, in order to be secured
from their raids. The Texans were at first friendly with the Comanche; but in
1832 a Mexican deputation visited the border tribes, and incited them against
the Texans. Open war broke out in 1837, and several battles were fought. In
February, 1840, twelve chiefs with a numerous retinue came to San Antonio to
make peace. Refusing to deliver up their white captives, troops were set upon
them, and in the ensuing mêlée all the chiefs and twenty other Indians were killed.
The Comanche retired to plan revenge. Early in August, they advanced, avoiding
Austin and San Antonio, and fell upon the town of Victoria. The inhabitants
resisting, about fifteen of them were killed. When the Indians reached Linnville,
a village of only five houses, its inhabitants fled to a ship in the bay, whereupon
the hamlet was destroyed. A pursuing party under General Felix Houston defeated
the natives, and recovered the white prisoners. In September, an expedition
headed by Colonel John Moore attained the Comanche village high up on
the Colorado River, and severely chastised them, killing one hundred and twenty-eight,
and capturing thirty-two. After this the Comanche avoided the Texans
for some years.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<a id="TRANSCRIBER_NOTE"></a>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:

<p>Original spelling and grammar has mostly been retained. Figures
were moved from within paragraphs to between paragraphs. Footnotes
were moved to the ends of chapters. This 1905 edition is an annotated
reprint of "Part II of Gregg's Commerce of the Prairies, 1831-1839";
the pagination of the latter document is shown herein as a number
enclosed in curly brackets, e.g. {226}. The pagination of the
1905 publication is shown in square brackets, e.g. [p009]. <span
class="smcap">Small caps</span> are not well supported in mobile
formats, so they are reinforced with an underline herein.</p>

<p>The Transcriber created the cover page, and hereby
places it in the public domain.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg078">78</a>: the phrase "invicta, la Galia indomable" is printed upside
down. This was not a mistake, as it is explained in a following
paragraph. This has been reproduced herein as well as possible
("ıuʌıɔʇɐ lɐ פɐlıɐ ıupoɯɐqlǝ"), using Unicode characters. Some of
these characters may not be properly displayed in all browsers and
fonts.</p>

<p>Footnote <a href="#Footnote_59_59">59</a>:
the original large table was broken into two pieces.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg099">99</a>: "ofthe regular Route" was changed to "of the regular Route".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg144">144</a>: "consipracy" was changed to "conspiracy".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg145">145</a>: "futurese curity" to "future security".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg168">168</a>: an initial quotation mark was added to "he is prying into
 your affairs".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Pg173">173</a>: "mattrass" to "mattress".</p>

<p>Footnote <a href="#Footnote_123_123">123</a>: "Jesus Maria" changed to "Jesus-Maria".</p>
